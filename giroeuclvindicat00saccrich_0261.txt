hypothesis of acute angle, is to be thought equal to the
opposite base AB. -

And that is what I had undertaken again to demon-
strate by this new method.

SCHOLION ΙΙ.

But again: since the straight BA is discerned as suc-
cessively described by the points of the semicircumference
BLD by that motion always uniform and continuous ; to
which description corresponds the description of that line
DKC by the diametrically correlative points of the other
semicircumference BHD: it is easy to understand, that
this straight BA by that motion always uniform, and con·-
tinuous is described by the one point B, which of course
(as if unrolled) is thought always to run out with that
semicircumference upon BA; whilst meanwhile in exactly
the same time, by the same motion always uniform, and
continuouS, is described that other DKC by the other one
diametrically correlative point D, which again itself (as
if unrolled) is thought with its other semicircumference
BHD always to run out upon the aforesaid DKC.

But then is more easily understood the asserted equal-
ity between DKC, and the straight BA opposite it; since
the two are imagined to be described 1n equal time, and
equal motion by two exactly equal pointS‚ or, if you pre-
fer, infinitesimaIS.

Where it holds that this exact equality of the aforesaid

points is not necessary for me in that new considera-
tion. [95]

PRO POSITION XXXVIII.

The hypothesis of acute anyle is absolutely false, because
it destroys itself.

Pnoop. Assuredly we have above clearly deduced
from the hypothesis of acute angle, that the curve CKD
