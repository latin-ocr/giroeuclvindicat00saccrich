T herefore the product of A, B is equal to the product
of E, G.

Whence, as A to E, so is G to B [VII. 19].

But A, E are prime; primes are also least [VII. 21]‚
and do equally measure those that have the same ratio as
they, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the
consequent [VII. 20] :

Wherefore E measures B.

Let it measure it by H; then E multiplying H produces
B. But A has also by multiplying itself made B [IX. 8] ;
therefore the product of E, H is equal to the product of
A into itself.

Therefore‚ as E to A, so is A to H [VII. 19].

But A, E are prime; primes are also least [VII. 21]‚ and
the least measure those which have the same ratio the same
number of timeS, the antecedent the antecedent and the
consequent the consequent [VII. 20] ; therefore E measures
A, as antecedent antecedent. Q. E. D.

The comment of Clavius is:

“Est autem res admirabilis huius propositionis demon-
stratio. Nam ex eo quod b dicatur non metiri ipsum a,
ostendit, demonstratione affirmativa, b ipsum a metiri, quod
videtur fieri non posse. Nam si quis demonstrare instituat
Socratem esse album, ex eo quod non est albuS, paradoxum
aliquid et inopinatum in medio videatur afferre: cui tamen
non absimile quid factum hic est in numeris ab Euclide, et
in aliis nonnullis propositionibus quae sequuntur.'’

Now the edition of Clavius was the Euclid recommended
by T. Ceva to Saccheri. .

This recondite legerdemain of logie, so striking to Cardan
and ClaviUS, seized with a more permanent fascination the
adroit mind of the subtle Saccheri. It is the dominant note
of the Loyica demonstrativa, and thence adventures the
quest of the holy grail‚ Euclid's Parallel Postulate.

This type of reasoning consists in assuming as hypothesis
the falsity of the very proposition to be proved, and in show-
ing how also when taking this hypothesis as point of de-
