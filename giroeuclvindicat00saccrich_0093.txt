suppose, one right, and the other less than a right by as
much as two degreeS, or, if you please, by less; who is
so devoid of geometry that he could not immediately
show the thing itself demonstratively?
For suppose (fig. 12) given
any angle BAP, aS, say, 88 de-
greeS. If therefore from any
point B of this AB, is let fall on Χ
the base ΑΡ (Eu. 1. 12) the Κ
perpendicular BP, it holds cer-
tainly thatin this triangle ABP uA
would be exhibited demonstra· ι
tively the desired concurrence Fig.12.
at this point B.
But if the other angle at the base is postulated, and
is less than a right, aS, suppose, 84 degreeS, which indeed
the given angle K represents: then (Eu’. Ι. 23) one

would be able to make toward the parts of the straight
AB an equal angle APD, PD meeting this AB in D,

 

some intermediate point of it. Wherefore the desired
concourse is again obtained demonstratively in this
point D.

But finally: if the other angle is postulated obtuse,
but yet less than 92 degreeS, lest with the other given
angle BAP it should make up two rights: this may be
represented in a certain angle R of 91 degreeS. It is to
be shown, that there is some point X of this ΑΡ, to which
the join ΒΧ makes an angle BXA equal to the given
angle R of 91 degrees: so that therefore under a certain

cutting straight AX the desired meeting in the point B
may be obtained.

Now we may proceed thuS.

PA being produced to any point H, since the external
angle BAH is (Eu. Ι. 13) 92 degreeS, because the interior
angle BAP is by hypothesis 88 degrees; and again (Eu.
