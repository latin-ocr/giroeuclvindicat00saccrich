AXB, and AXC produced through the point X in the
same plane. Then with center X, and radius XB‚ or XC,
describe the arc BMC, to any point of which M is drawn-
from the first point X the straight XM.

Ι say first, under the assumed hypothesis also the line
AXM will be [74] a straight line,
continued from the point A through L
the point X.

For if a line of this sort be not
straight, there can be drawn (from
Cor. I. of the preceding lemma) a
certain other line AM, which itself
is straight. But this either cuts in
some point K one or the other of
those straights XB‚ XC ; or it in-
closes one or the other of them, as suppose XB within
the space bounded by AX, XM, and APLM.

But the first of these is manifestly contrary to the
preceding lemma; because thus two lines supposed
straight, one AXK, and the other ΛΤΚ, would inclose
a space. .

But the second is at once convicted of a like absurdity.

For it is certain that the straight XB‚ if produced on
through B, will at length meet this APLM in some point
L ; whence again two lines supposed straight, one AXBL,
and the other APL, will inclose a space. But a like absurdity
follows, if we assume, that the straight XB‚ produced on
through B, at length meets in some other point either the
straight XM, or the straight XA.

But from this evidently follows that the line AXM
is itselt', in the assumed hypothesiS, the straight line
drawn from the point A to the point M.

Quod erat propositum.

 

I say secondly‚ that the assumed straight AXB (inas-
much as it is understood to retain its arbitrary continuation
