corresponding partS, of which it is certain they are equal
to each other.

Now for the proof of the proposition.

Suppose erected from the base AB to the curve CKD
(fig. 45) indefinitely many perpendiculars NF, LF, PF,
MK, TF, VF, IF ; and on the base AB take as equal the
portions AN, NL, LP, PM, MT, TV, VI, IB.

First is certain the angle of AC with the curve will
be equal to each of the angles of the aforesaid perpen-
diculars with the curve on either side at the points F, or
at the point K, or at the point D. For if the mixed
quadrilateral [91] ANFC is supposed to be superposed
upon the mixed quadrilateral NLFF‚ the base AN lying
upon the equal base NL, AC falls upon NF, and NF
upon LF, because of the equal right angles at the points
A, N, L. Then because of the equality (from P.
XXXIV.) of the straights AC, NF, LF, the point C falls
upon point F of NF, and this upon the other poi-nt F
of LF.

Moreover the curve CF exactly fits the curve FF:
for if one of these, as CF fell within or without; any
point Q being assumed between points N, and L, and the
perpendicular being drawn cutting one curve in X, and
the other in S, QX, QS would be equal (from the known
nature of this curve), which is absurd. The same will

     

hold, if in the said superposition the straight NF remains
in its place, and the straight AC falls upon LF. Again
