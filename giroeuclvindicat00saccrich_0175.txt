which there is no common perpendicular, and therefore
which according to the assumed definition are not parallel,
must, being produced toward either part ever more, some-
where meet each other, if not at [55] a finite, at least at
an infinite distance.

For again it would be requisite to demonstrate, that
any two straights existing in the same plane, upon which
a certain straight cutting makes two internal angles toward
the same parts less than two right angleS‚ nowhere else
can receive a common perpendicular.

But that, this demonstrated‚ Euclidean geometry is
most exactly established, will be shown below.

PROPOSITION XXVI.

If the aforesaid AX, ΒΧ (fiy. 31) must indeed meet

each other, but only at their infinite productiori
toward the parts of the point X: I say there will

be no assiynable point T in ΑΒ, from which a per-
pendicular erected toward the parts of AX does not
at a finite, or terminated distance meet this AX in
some point F.

ο PROOF. For (from the preceding hypothesis) there
will be in AX some point N, from which the perpen-
