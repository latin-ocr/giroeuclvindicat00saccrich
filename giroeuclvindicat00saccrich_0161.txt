PROPOSITION XXIV.

The same remaininyz I say the four angles toyether
(fiy. 27) of the quadrilateral KDHK nearer the
base AB arerless (in the hypothesis of acute anyle)
than the four angles together of the quadrilateral
KHLK more remote from the same base3 and in-
deed this is sa, whether those two AX, ΒΧ some-
where at a finite distance meet toward the parts os
the point X ; or never meet one
anathem but toward those parts
either ever more mutually ap·
proach each other, or some-
where receive a common per-
pendicular, after which of
course (in accordance with Cor.
II. of the preceding proposi-
tion) toward the same parts Fig. ²7·
they beyin mutually to separate.

 

· PRoOF. Here however we suppose the portions KK

assumed to be mutually equal. Since therefore (from'
the preceding) [49] the side DK is greater than the side
HK, and similarly HK greater than the side LK, the
portion MK in HK is assumed equal to LK, and in
DK the portion NK equal to HK; and MN, MK, LK
are joined, truly the intermediate point K with the point
L, and the point K nearer to the point B with the point M.

Now I proceed thus,

Since indeed the sides of the triangle KKL (I make
beginning always from the point K nearer to the point Β)
are equal to the sides of the triangle KKM, and the in-
cluded angles equal‚ as being right, equal also will be

(from Eu. I. 4) the bases LK, MK, and likewise equal
the angles which correspond mutually, at these baseS,
