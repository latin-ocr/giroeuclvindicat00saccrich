be located in that plane, that with its fixed segment AX
it fits a certain other, AXC, in so far as truly the pro-
longation AXC toward the right is exactly similar, or
equal to the prolongation AXB toward the left, and more-
over the prolongation AXC toward the left is precisely
similar, or equal to the prolongation AXB toward the right.

This remaining: if, assuming any point M in the arc
BC, we join XM; either the prolongation AXM will be
[78] precisely uniform in relation to the left, and the
right side of AX; or not. If the first; I shall demon-
strate of AXM, what immediately Ι shall have demon-
strated of the prolongation AXD. If the second, there-
fore the aforesaid AXM can in turn be so located in the
same plane, that with the same fixed segment AX it fits
a certain other AXF, in which truly the prolongation
AXF toward the right is precisely similar, or equal to
the prolongation AXM toward the left, and moreover the
continuation AXF toward the left is precisely similar, or
equal to the prolongation AXM toward the right.

Furthermore, since the point M may be supposed
nearer to the point B than is the point C, the point F does
not fall upon the point C; because thus the prolongation
AXM toward the left would be precisely similar, or
equal to the prolongation AXF, or AXC toward the
right, and therefore precisely similar, or equal to the
prolongation AXB toward the left, which is absurd, since
the two XM, XB do not mutually fit each other in such
position of theirS.

But neither also is the point F beyond the point C in
the arc BC produced farther on; because thus by like
reasoning is shown, against the hypothesiS‚ that also the
point M must be in the arc CB produced farther on, so
that XM would divide toward the left the arbitrary angle
AXB, just as XF would be posited to divide toward the
right the arbitrary angle AXC: I say must so lie, to the
