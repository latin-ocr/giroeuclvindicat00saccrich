Which standing, it follows that no hindrance can
intervene.

SCHOLION.

N evertheless it might be doubted, whether a perpen-
dicular, from whatever point K (assumed indeed in ΒΧ
before the meeting of this ΒΧ with the other AX) erected
toward the parts of the straight
AX, must meet this (fig. 29) in
some point L} provided of course
’ those two, before the aforesaid
meeting‚ are assumed ever more to
approach each other mutually. But
I say it will follow completely thuS.

PROOF. Let there be assigned
in ΒΧ any point whatever K. In “ Fig. 29.

AX is taken a certain AM equal
to the sum of this ΒΚ and of twice ΑΒ.

Then from the point M is drawn to ΒΧ (according
to Eu. I. 12) the perpendicular ΜΝ. According to the
present supposition, MN will be less than ΑΒ. Where-
fore AM (made equal to the sum of ΒΚ and of double
AB) will be greater than the sum of BK, AB, and NM.
Now it behooves to show this same AM to be less than the
sum of ΒΝ, ΑΒ, and MN, that thence it may follow this ·
ΒΝ is greater than the aforesaid BK, and therefore the
point K lies between the points B and N.

Join ΒΜ. The side AM will be (from Eu. I. 20) less
than the two remaining sides together AB and ΒΜ.
Again [51] the side ΒΜ (from the same Eu. I. 20) will be
less than the two sides together BN and MN. Therefore
the side AM will be by much less than the three sides to·
gether AB, BN, and NM. But this was to be shown, in
order to deduce that the point K lies between the points
B and N. Thence however it follows, that the perpen-
