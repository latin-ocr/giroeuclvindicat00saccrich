But what Ι say for finding points between the points
C and K, the same also holds good uniformly for finding
points between the points K and D; of course the curve
[88] CKD, arising from the hypothesis of acute angle,
is the line joining the extremities of all equal perpendicu-
lars erected upon the same base toward the same part,
which assuredly can come under the name ordinates; it is,
Ι may say, a line of such sort, that on account of the
hypothesis of acute angle, from which it ariseS, it always
is con-cave toward the parts of the opposite base AB.

Quod quidem hoc loco declarandum, ac demonstran-
dum a nobis erat.

PROPOSITION XXXV.

If from any point L of the base ΑΒ the ordinate LF is
drawn to this curve CKD: I say the straiyht NFX
perpendicular to LF must on both sides fall wholly
toward the convex parts of this curve, and therefore
it will be tangent to this curve.

PROOF. For if possible, let a certain point X (fig. 43)
of NF X fall within the cavity
of this curve. Let fall from
the point X to the base AB the
perpendicular XP, which pro-
longed through X meets the
curve in a certain point R. Now
thus, In the quadrilateral LFXP
the angle at the point X will be
neither right nor obtuse: else
(P. V. and P. VI.) would be destroyed the present hy-
pothesis of acute angle.

Therefore the aforesaid angle will be acute. Where-
fore (from Cor. Ι. to P. ΙΙΙ.) ΡΧ and so much more
PR will be greater than LF. But this is absurd (from
the preceding) against the nature of this curve.
