the straight MH stand perpendicular two straights AM,
CH, and at the join AC is a right angle at A, the straight
CH will not be equal to this AM (as above), since the
angle at C is not right. But neither will it be less:
otherwise, if in HC produced HL is taken equal to this
AM, the angles at the join AL will be (as above) equal.

But this is absurd. For the angle MAL is by con-
struction greater than the assumed right MAC; and the
angle HLA is by construction internal, and opposite, and
therefore less than (Eu. Ι. 16) the external HCA‚ which
is assumed acute.

It remains therefore, that CH, Whilst the angles at
the join CD are acute, is greater than this AM, and there-
fore CD the double of the former is greater than AB the
double of the latter.

Quod erat tertio loco demonstrandum.

Therefore it is established that the join CD will be
equal t0, or less, [4] or greater than this AB, according
as the angles at the same CD are, right, or obtuse, or
acute.

Quae erant demonstranda.

COROLLARY Ι.

Hence in every quadrilateral containing assuredly
three right angleS‚ and one obtuse, or acute, the sides
adjacent to this oblique angle are less respectively than
the opposite sides if this angle is obtuse, but greater if
it is acute.

For this has just now been demonstrated of the side
CH relatively to the opposite side AM; in the same way
it is demonstrated of the side AC relatively to the oppo-
site side MH. For since the straights AC, MH, are
perpendicular to this AM, they cannot (P. Ι.) be mutually
equal, on account of the unequal angles at the join CH.

But neither (in the hypothesis of an obtuse angle at
