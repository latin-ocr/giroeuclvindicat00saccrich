Wherefore (Eu. Ι. 19) the join DA will be greater
than the join DS, and the join supposed equal to it DM.

Quod erat secundo loco demonstrandum. Itaque con-
stant proposita. [13]

PROPOSITION XI.

Let the straiyht ΑΡ (as lony as you choose) cut the two
straights PL, AD (fiy. 9), the first indeed at right
angles in P, but the latter at A in any acute angle
converyiny toward the parts PL. I say the straiyhts
AD, PL (in the hypothesis of riyht anyle) will at
lenyth meet in some point, and indeed at a finite, or
terminated distance, if they are prolonyed toward
those parts on which they make with the transversal
ΑΡ two anyles together less than two riyht anyleS.

PROOF. Prolong DA toward the other parts even to
some point X, and through A erect to AP the perpendic-
ular HAC, the point H being toward the parts of the
angle XAP.

 

Then in AD produced toward the parts of PL assume
two equal intervals AD, DF, and let fall upon the trans-
versal ΑΡ the perpendiculars DB, F M, which certainly
(Eu. I. 17) fall toward the parts of the acute angle DAP;
