It is certain first that as to all its points the whole
diameter MAN will remain in the same place; lest two
straight lines (against the preceding Lemma Ι) inclose a
space.

It is certain secondly that no point K of the circum-
ference NKM will fall either within, or without the sur-
face inclosed by the diameter MAN, and the other cir-
cumference NHDM; lest obviously against the nature of
the circle, one radiuS, for example AK, be leSS, or greater
than another radius of the same circle, for example AH.

It is certain thirdly that any radius MA can alone be
prolonged in a straight line by [84] a certain other radius
AN, lest (against the preceding Lemma ΙΙ) two lines
assumed straight, as suppose MAN, MAH‚ should have
one and the same common segment MA.

It is certain fourthly (from the immediately preceding
lemma) that all the diameters of the circle cut one an-
other in the center, and from the known nature of the
circle bisect.

From all which can be established, that not only the
diameter MAN most exactly divides its circle, and the
circumference of it into two equal partS, but also that
this may be assumed universally for any diameter of this
circle. Quod erat etc.

SCHOLION.

We read in Clavius that this truth was demonstrated

by Thales of Miletus, but perhaps not to the exhausting
of every objection.

LEMMA V.

Amony rectilinear anyleS, all riyht angles are exactly
equal to one another, without any devia-
tion even infinitely small.

PROOF. Euclid defines a rectilinear angle as right:
which is equa! to its adjacent. This he does not postu-
