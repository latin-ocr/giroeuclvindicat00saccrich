DC it will never be certain that this is a straight line,
whatever relation finally is supposed or demonstrated of
all its points to the underlying straight AB in the same
plane; but especially we must not say analogically that
no other line in this plane will be straight which in all
its points is not equidistant from this line AB supposed
straight. [38]

Nor finally do Ι wish this dictum of mine so taken,
as if Ι think it cannot be demonstrated, that the line thus
generated is itself a straight line, except after truth dern-
onstrated of the controverted postulate; since rather Ι
myself will demonstrate it toward the end of this Book,
for confirming such postulate itself.

SCHOLION III.

In which is weiyhed the endeavor of the Arab N asiraddin,
and likewise the idea of the illustrious J ohn
Wallis upon the same affair.

This endeavor of the Arab Nasiraddin the above
eulogized John Wallis has published in the Latin language
with remarks added in opportune place.

However Nasiraddin requires two things to be con-

ceded to him in this affair.
- The first is; that any two straight lines lying in the
same plane, upon which ever so many other straight lines
so strike‚ that they are always perpendicular to one indeed
of these, but always cut the other at unequal angleS‚ truly
toward one part always under an acute angle, and toward
the other always under an obtuse angle; that, Ι say, the
above-mentioned lines be supposed always more (as long
as they do not mutually cut) to approach each other toward
the side of those acute angles; and on the other hand
always more to recede from one another toward the parts
of the obtuse angles,

But I indeed, if nothing else impedes Nasiraddin, wil-
