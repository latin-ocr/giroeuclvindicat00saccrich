, (fig. 46) born of it must be equal to the opposite base

AB. But now we deduce the contradictory from the
same hypothesiS, that the curve
CKD cannot be equal to that
base, since surely it is greater
than it.

For that the curve CKD is
'greater than the straight CD
joining its extremitieS, the no-
tion is common to all, which also
we may demonstrate from Eu.
I. 20, that two sides of a triangle
are always greater than the third, join CK, and KD;
and again join likewise the apiceS, first of tw0, then of
four, and 5ο on in infinitum, the number of the produced
segments doubling, until the whole curve CKD is under-
stood in this way to be exhausted‚ or to end in those
infinitely small chordS‚ or tangentS.

However here we may proceed from the common
notion alone.

But that the join CD is greater than the base AB, has
been demonstrated by us in P. III. from the very viscera
of the hypothesis of acute angle.

Therefore the curve CKD, born of the hypothesis of
acute angle, is certainly greater than the base AB, because
it is greater, anyhow from the common notion‚ than the
straight CD, which from the hypothesis of acute angle
is demonstrated greater than the base AB. Therefore
cannot at the same time stand, that the curve CKD is
equal to the base AB.

Consequently is established that the hypothesis of
acute angle is absolutely false, because it destroys itself.
