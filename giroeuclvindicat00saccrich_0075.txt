PROPOSITION VIII.

Given any trianyle (fiy. 7) ABD, riyht-anyled at B‚· pro-
lony DA to any point X, and through Α erect HAC
perpendicular to AB, the point
H beiny within the anyle ΧΑΒ.
Ι say the external angle XAH
will be equal ta, or leSS, or
yreater than the internal and op-
posite ADB, accordiny as is true
the hypothesis of riyht anyle, or Α . β
obtuse angle, or acute anyle: and χ · Η
inversely. ’ Fig. 7·

C. D

PROOF. Assume in HC the portion AC equal to BD,
and join CD. CD will be, in the hypothesis of right
angle (P. ΙΙΙ.) equal to AB. Wherefore the angle ADB
will be equal (Eu. Ι. 8) to the angle DAC, or to its equal
(Eu. Ι. 15) the angle XAH.

Quod erat primo loco demonstrandum.

Then, in the hypothesis of obtuse angle, CD will be
(P. ΙΙΙ.) less than AB.

Wherefore in the triangles ADB, DAC the angle
' DAC, or its vertical XAH, will be (Eu. Ι. 25) less than
the angle ADB.

Quod erat *secundo loco demonstrandum.

Finally‚ in the hypothesis of acute angle, CD will be
(P. ΙΙΙ.) greater than the opposite AB. Wherefore in
the said triangle the angle DAC, or its vertical XAH, will
be (En. Ι. 25) greater than the angle ADB.

Quod erat tertio loco demonstrandum.

But inversely: if the angle CAD, or its vertical XAH,
be equal to the internal and opposite ADB ; the join CD
will be (Eu. Ι. 4) equal to AB, and therefore [11] the hy-
pothesis of right angle will be (P. IV.) true.
