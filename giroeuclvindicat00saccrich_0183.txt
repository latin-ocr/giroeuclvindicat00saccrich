angles; and therefore the four angles together of the first
quadrilateral KLHK, which indeed in this regard has
been shown the greatest of all, will fall short of four
right angles by less than the ninth part of one right angle.
Wherefore, these quadrilaterals being multiplied beyond
any assignable finite number, proceeding always toward
the parts of the points X, it holds in the same way (as in
the same already recited theorem) that the four angles
together of this stable quadrilateral KHLK will fall short
of four right angles less than any assignable little portion
of one right angle.

Therefore these four angles together will be either
equal to four right angleS‚ or greater.

But then (from P. XVI.) is established the hypoth-
esis of right angle or of obtuse angle; and therefore
(from Propp. V. and VI.) is destroyed the hypothesis
of acute angle.

So then it holds, that there will be no place for the
hypothesis of acute angle, if the straight AX drawn under
however small angle from the point A of AB must at
length meet (anyhow at an infinite distance) any perpen-
dicular ΒΧ, which is supposed erected at any distance
from this point A upon this secant AB.

Quod erat etc.

SCHOLION Ι.

And this it is, that Ι said before in Cor. ΙΙ. to P.
XXV.; obviously that no place would remain over for
the hypothesis of acute angle, [59] or Euclidean geometry
would be most exactly established, if any two straights
existing in the same plane, as suppose AX, ΒΧ, which
the straight AB meeting (the point B being assumed at
a distance from the point A as great as you choose)
makes with them toward the same parts of the points X
two angles less than two right angleS‚ if (I say) nowhere
