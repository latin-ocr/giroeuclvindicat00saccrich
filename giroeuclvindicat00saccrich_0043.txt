attempted its demonstration from those propositions of
Euclid's First Book alone which precede the twenty-
ninth‚ wherein begins the use of the controverted propo-
sition. [x]

But again, since the endeavors of the ancients in this
matter do not seem to attain the goal, so it has happened
that many distinguished geometers of ensuing timeS, at-
tacking the same idea, have thought necessary a new
definition of parallels Thus, while Euclid defines paral-
lels as straight lines lyiny in the same plane, which, if
infinitely produced toward both sideS, nowhere meet, they
substitute for the last words of the given definition these
others: always equidistant from each other; so that all
perpendiculars from any points on one of them let fall
upon the other are equal to one another.

But again here arises a new fissure. For some, and
these surely the keenest, endeavor to demonstrate the
existence of parallel straight lines as so defined, whence
they go up to the proof of the debated proposition as
stated in Euclid's termS, upon which truly from that
twenty-ninth of Euclid's First Book (with some very
few exceptions) all geometry rests, But others (not
without gross sin against rigorous logie) assume such
parallel straight lineS, forsooth equidistant, as if given,
that thence they may go up to what remains to be proved.

And this is enough to indicate to the reader what will
be the material of the First Book of this work of mine:
for a more complete explication of all that has been said
will be given in the scholia after the twenty-first propo-
sition of this Book.

I divide this Book into two parts. In the First Part
I will imitate the antique geometerS, and not trouble my-
self about the nature or the name of that line which at
all its points is equidistant from a certain line supposed
straight3 but merely undertake without any petitio prin-
