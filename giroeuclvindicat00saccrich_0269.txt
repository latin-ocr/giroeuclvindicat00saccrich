Hence in P. XIV. I declare the absolute falsity of the
hypothesis of obtuse angle, because it destroys itself,
inasmuch as it occasions the truth of the aforesaid axiom,
from which against the remaining two hypotheses place
is left for the hypothesis of right angle alone. Therefore
remains only the' hypothesis of acute angle, against which
was longer to be fought.

And of this indeed (after many thingS‚ I do not say
all, circumstantially considered) at length in P. XXXIII.
I show the absolute falsity, because repugnant to the na-
ture of the straight line, about which I there introduce
many necessary lemmata.

Finally in the preceding proposition I absolutely prove
the hypothesis of acute angle contradictory to itself.

’ Since therefore [98] the hypothesis of right angle
alone remainS, the consequence plainly is, that from the
aforesaid P. XIII. remains absolutely established the
enunciated Euclidean axiom.

Quod erat propositum.

SCHOLION.

It is well to consider here a notable difference between
the foregoing refutations of the two hypotheses, For
in regard to the hypothesis of obtuse angle the thing
is clearer than midday light; since from it assumed as
true is demonstrated the absolute universal truth of the
controverted Euclidean postulate, from which afterward
is demonstrated the absolute falsity of this hypothesis;
as is established from P. XIII. and P. XIV.

But on the contrary I do not attain to proving the
falsity of the other hypothesiS, that of acute angle, with·
out previously proving; that the line, all of whose points
are equidistant from an assumed straight line lying in
the same plane with it, is equal to this straight, which
itself finally I do not appear to demonstrate from the
