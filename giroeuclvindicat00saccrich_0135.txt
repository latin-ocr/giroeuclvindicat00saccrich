but to something ‘else‚ forsooth to a certain other point
A existing in the same plane with it, which is its center.
The consequence therefore is, as is .-

most excellently [37] demonstrated by b H
ClaviuS‚ that the line FBCL existing in η *Q*

the same plane with it, and whose b„

points are all equidistant from the κ
aforesaid MDHNM, is also itself cir· Fig. 23.
cular, truly equidistant in all its points from the common
center A. That in fact BD, which is the continuation in
a straight of AB, is the measure of the distance of that
point B from this circle MDHNM follows from this;
because ( from Eu. ΙΙΙ. 7, which is independent of the
postulate here in controversy) this is the smallest of all,
which can fall from this point upon this circumference.
The same holds of the remaining CH, LN‚ FM.

Since therefore also the wholes AM, AD, AH, are
equal as radii from the center A to the line assumed
circular MDHNM; and also the sections FM, BD, CH,
LN are equal‚ which obviously are the measure of the
equal distance of all points of that line FBCLF from this
line presumed circular MDHNM; the consequence plainly
is, that equal likewise are the remainders AF, AB, AC,
AL, and therefore also this line FBCLF is a circle with
the same center A.

But now likewise, for demonstrating that the line
DC (fig. 21) generated through such a motion by the
point D is a straight line will the equidistance of all its
points from the underlying straight AB be sufficient?
In no way.

For a line is called straight absolutely in reference to
itself, or in itself, doubtless as lyiny ex aequo between its
points, and especially end pointS‚ so that these remaining
unmoved it cannot be revolved into occupying a new place.
Unless this state in some way be demonstrated of this
