Finally, however; since FS is greater (by Eu. I. 19)
than QS and so much greater than BT or CN, assume
in F S the piece IS equal to CN, and from the point Ι
erect to FS the perpendicular IR meeting AS in the
point R.

But the point R falls between the points A and S:
for if it fell on any point of AF, we would have in the
same triangle (against Eu. I. 17) two angles greater
than two right angleS, since the angle at the point F
toward the parts of the point A has already been shown
obtuse.

After so much preparation thus I conclude. Since
in the quadrilateral AOIR the angles at the points O and Ι
are right, and the angle at the point A (by Eu. Ι. 17)
is acute because of the right angle AOS, and again the
angle IRA (by Eu. Ι. 16) is obtuse, [62] since the angle
RIS is right: the consequence finally is (by Cor. ΙΙ. to
P. III.) that the side AO is greater than the side IR.

But (OQ joined) the side ΑΩ is greater (by Eu.
Ι. 19) than the side Ao, because of the obtuse angle at
O, since the angle AOS was made right.

Therefore the straight AQ will be much greater than
the straight IR, or (by Eu. Ι. 26) than the straight MC,
and so much greater than the straight AB, the part than
the whole; which 1s absurd.

Therefore it is not possible to assign any one angle
MNC, than which always is greater, or anyhow not leSS,
the excess of each of the aforesaid obtuse angles above
a right angle. ,

Wherefore those obtuse angleS, more and more dis-
tant from this point A, ever more without any certain
limit approach to equality with a right angle.

Quod erat postremo loco demonstrandum.
