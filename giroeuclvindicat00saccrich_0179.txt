without any certain limit, approaches the other ever pro-
duced straight AX.

COROLLARY III.

Whence finally follow3‚ that not even at its infinite
production can ΒΧ be cut by that AX; because otherwise
from any point of that AX beyond the aforesaid inter-
section a certain perpendicular ZM could be supposed
let fall to AB produced; whence again would follow, that
ΒΧ (against the present hypothesis) met the aforesaid
AX not at an infinite, but wholly at a finite distance.

But this last dictum is beyond necessity. [57]

PROPOSITION XXVII.

I f a straight AX (ᾖς. 32) drawn at any however small
anyle from the point Α of AB, must at lenyth meet
(anyhow at an infinite distance) any perpendicular
ΒΧ, which is supposed erected at any distance from
this point A upon the secant AB: I say there will
then be no more place for the hypothesis of acute
anyle.

 

PRoor. 2 From any point K chosen at will in AB near
the point A, the perpendicular KL is erected to AB,
which certainly (from Cor. ΙΙ. of the preceding propo-
sition) meets AX at a finite or terminated distance in
