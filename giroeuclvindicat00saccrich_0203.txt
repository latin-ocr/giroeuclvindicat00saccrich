PROPOSITION· XXXI.

Now I say there will be, of the aforesaid common perpene
diculars in two distinct pointS, no determinate amit,
such that under a smaller and smaller acute anyle
made at the point A, it would not always be possible
to attain (in the hypothesis of acute angle) to such α
common perpendicular in two distinct points as is
less than any assignable length R.

PROOF. For in so far as the thing were otherwise;
if from the point K (resume fig. 30) in ΒΧ assigned at
any however great distance from
the point B, a perpendicular KL
is erected, to which from point A
(by Eu. Ι. 12) the perpendicular
AL is supposed let fall, KL ought
to be greater than the length R.

The reason is; because a higher
point Q being assumed in t'his ΒΧ, y
from which is erected to ΒΧ the
perpendicular QF, to which (by
the same Eu. Ῑ. 12) a perpendic-

 

ular AF is let fall, this again must anyhow not be less
than the length R.

But KL (from Cor. to preceding proposition) will
be greater than QF. Therefore KL would be greater
than the aforesaid length R. And so ever proceeding
higher.

But now, if this however great KB is supposed divided
(as in P. XXV.) into portions KK, equal to the length
R, and from these points K perpendiculars are erected,
which meet AX in points H, D, M; the angles at these
pointS, toward the parts of the point L, will neither be
right nor obtuse; lest in some quadrilateral‚ as suppose
