Therefore this BC either will cut XD (or the as-
sumed straight DXC) in some point L; and then again
two straight lineS, one LC, portion ot‘ this BC, and the
other LXC, portion ot‘ the aforesaid DXC, inclose a
space; or one of the extreme points whether A of BA,
or D of CXD, is inclosed within the space bounded by
CX, XB, and either BFC, or BHC.

But in either case the same absurdity follows: For
whether BA produced through A strikes BFC in a point
F ; or CXD produced through D strikes BHC in a point
H; always we come upon the same absurdity, that two
straights inclose a space; forsooth either the straight[83l
BF portion of BFC together with the other BAF ; or the
straight HC, portion of BHC, together with the other
assumed straight prolonged CXDH.

Furthermore the same, or a greater absurdity fol-
lows, if BA produced through A meets in any point
either CX, or its own self in any point of its portion XB.

And this likewise holds, if the other CXD produced
through D meets in any point either XB, or its own sels
in any point of its portion CX.

Therefore is established, that two straights AB, CXD
meeting each other in any intermediate point X of theirS,
do not there touch each other, but one will cut the other
there.

LEMMA IV.

Every diameter bisects its circle, and the circumference
of it.

PROOF. Let there be a circle (recall fig. 23) MDH-
NKM, A its center, and MN a diameter. Of this circle
the portion MNKM is thought so to revolve about the
fixed points M, and N, that at length it is superimposed

upon, or applied to the remaining portion MNHDM.
