be acute. In the hypothesis of acute angle, the angle
BMH is also (from the preceding

proposition) acute. Therefore the t<
perpendicular BDX, let fall from the χ
point B to this HM, will cut (by

Eu. I. 17) this HM in some inter· q ., m

mediate point D. Therefore the angle .
XBA will be acute.

But it follows (Eu. Ι. 17) that Α Fig 16 Β
those two straights AHK, BDX how· ’ ’
ever produced cannot meet (anyhow at a finite or ter-
minated distance) on account of the right angles at the
points H and D. Therefore in the hypothesis of acute
angle it cannot hold good, that any BD, making with
a straight AB, however small, any acute angle toward
the parts of this AH, perpendicular to this same AB,
will at length meet (at a finite or terminated distance)
this AH produced.

Quod erat propositum.

scHoLION 1.

And this is what I promised in the scholia after
P. ΧΙΙΙ., that the hypothesis of acute angle (which alone
is able now to stand against that general Euclidean as·-
sumption) will certainly be destroyed by the sole ad—
mission of a universal meeting of two straights toward
those parts toward which any straight, as small as you
choose‚ meeting them, makes two internal angles less than
two right angles; and just SO, even if either of those

, angles is to be supposed right.

SCHOLION ΙΙ,

But again in a better place, after'P. XXVII., I shall
show that the hypothesis of acute angle will be equally
destroyed, provided that any one acute angle as small as
