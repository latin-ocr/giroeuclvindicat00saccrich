of being mutually compatible‚ that is, of neither directly
nor indirectly contradicting one another, the question rela-
tive to the means of ascertaining whether such compati-
bility really existS, ceases to be, in Vailati's phrase, a pure
question de luxe, upon its solution having come to depend
the legitimacy and even the possibility of assuming a given
system of hypotheses as basis of a demonstrative science.

How high the merit of having been far the first to en-
visage this difficult matter and to have proffered an analysis
of the various forms of fallacy to which its non-recognition
may give rise!

Precisely to such subject is dedicated the final chapter
of the Loyica demonstrat-iva. And so ultra—modern and yet
unfinished is this whole question here raised and entered
upon first, that it beckons with rising interest to mathema-
ticians and philosophers toward this little book so near to
vanishing unrecognized from the earth.

“Huc usque de fallaciis communiter observatis Duas
adhuc superaddemus nec eas ut opinor parvi momenti.
Hanc ‘fallaciam complexi’ appeIIO, illam ‘duplicis defini—
tionis' seu ‘hypothesis' '⁹ (p. 256 of lst ed.).

The fallacy of “complex definitionS,'’ such as attribute
to the thing defined the simultaneous possession of diverse
propertieS, as for example Borelli’s of “parallel'’ the prop—
erty οἱ being a straight line and that of being also the locus
of points of a plane equidistant from another given straight,
consists in supposing that such definitions can be adopted
unchecked in the demonstrationS, without the compatibility
of the properties themselves having first been ascertained.

Obviously‚ in case such compatibility is lacking, in case
the existence of an object possessing simultaneously the
properties in question can be proved impossible (by means
of the other hypotheses anteriorly postulated as basis of
the demonstrative science under discussion), any argumen-
tation among whose premises figure such definitions com-
bined with the aforesaid hypotheseS, ceases to have value,
being based on contradictory premises “
