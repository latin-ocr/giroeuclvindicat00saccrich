dicular from the point K erected toward the parts of AX

must meet this in some point L stationed between the

points A and* M; else obviously (against Eu. Ι. 17) it

must cut either AB or MN perpendiculars to ΒΧ.

PROPOSITION XXV.

Is two straights (fiy. 30) AX, ΒΧ existiny in the same
plane (standing upon AB, one indeed at an acute
anyle in the point A, and the other perpendicular at
the point Β) so always approach more to each other
mutually, toward the parts of
the point X, that neverthe-
less their distance is always
preater than a certain as-
signed length, the hypothesis
of acute anyle is destroyed.

PROOF. Let R be the assigned
length, If therefore in ΒΧ is as-
sumed a certain ΒΚ any chosen
multiple of the proposed length
R ; it follows (from the preceding
scholion) that the perpendicular erected from the point K
toward the parts of AX will meet it at some point L ; and
again (from the present hypothesis) it follows that this
KL will be greater than the aforesaid length R. Further-
more ΒΚ is understood divided into portions KK, each
equal to R, even until KB is itself equal to the length R.
Finally from the points K are erected to ΒΧ perpen-
diculars meeting AX in points L, H, D, M, even to the
point N nearest the point A.

Now I proceed thus.
