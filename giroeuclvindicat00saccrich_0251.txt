angle at T) greater than LT, and this (because of the
right angle at Q) will be greater than QT. Therefore
LF will be much greater than QT, But hence ; if in QT
produced QK is taken equal to LF ; the point K (from
P. XXXIV.) will pertain to the present curve, and there-
fore point T falls within the cavity of this curve.

Therefore the straight FT, which cuts the two
straights QK, and LT in T, cannot be extended to cut
LS prolonged in the point X, situated without the cavity
of the present curve, unless previously the prolonged FT
cuts in some point O the portion of this curve situated
between the points S, and K. [90]

Hoc autem· erat demonstrandum.

COROLLARY.

And hence manifestly flows‚ that between the tangent
of this curve, and the curve itself cannot be placed any
straight, which, on one or the other side of the tangent
wholly falls without the cavity of the curve ; since a
straight so located must (from the preceding) make an
acute angle with the perpendicular let fall from the point
of contact to the opposite base.

PROPOSITION XXXVII.

The curve CKD, arisiny from the hypothesis of acute
angle, must be equal to the opposite base ΑΒ.

Before the demonstration I premise the following
axiom.

If two lines be bisected, then their halveS, and again
their quarters bisected, and so the process be continued
uniformly in infinitmm it will be safe to argue, those two
lines are equal to each other, as often as is ascertained,
or demonstrated in that uniform division in infinitum,
that at length must be attained two of their mutually
