Here, for instance, is the demonstration in nobiliorem
viam of the noted rule of the scholastic logie according to
which in syllogisms of the so-called First Figure (in syllo-
gismS, namely, in which the subject and the predicate of the
conclusion enter respectively as subject and predicate also
in the premises), the premise in which appears the subject
of the conclusion cannot be negative: In prima figura minor
non potest esse neyativa.

Taking the simplest particular case, it is to be proved
that from the two propositions:

Every A is a B,
No C is an A,

can be inferred no general proposition (affirmative or nega-
tive) having C as subject and B as predicate.

Proposing to demonstrate this rule by means of only the
syllogism Barbara, which has its two premises universal and
affirmative, Saccheri first observes that his aim would be
attained if, for each of the different forms of syllogisms
with negative minor premise constructible in the first figure,
he could succeed in finding examples (that is, could choose
such particular meanings for the terms entering) for which
the two premises being true, the conclusion was false:

“Si quispiam syllogismus taliter constructus non recte
concludit, nullus alius similiter constructus vi formae con-

cludet'' (Loyica dem„ p. 130).
[Is this Italy, 1697, or America, 1919?]
For example, to prove that, from the two premises

Every A is a B,
No C is an A,

we cannot deduce the conclusion

NoCisaB.

Attribute to the terms A, B, C, respectively the three
following significations:

A=syllogism of the first figure, having the two premises
universal and affirmative;

B = a valid syllogism;
