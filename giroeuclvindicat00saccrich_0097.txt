But this assumption holding good, on which Euclid
supports himself after Ι. 28, it is manifest to all geometers
that the hypothesis of right angle alone is true, nor any
place left for the hypothesis of obtuse angle. Therefore
the hypothesis of obtuse angle is absolutely false, because
it destroys itself.

Quod erat demonstrandum. [20]

Otherwise, and more immediately. Since from the
hypothesis of obtuse angle we have proved (P. IX.) that
two (fig. 11) acute angles of the triangle APX, right-
angled at P, are greater than one right angle3 it follows
that an acute angle PAD may be assumed such, that
together with the aforesaid two acute angles it makes
up two right angles, But then the straight AD must (by
the preceding proposition, joined to the hypothesis of
obtuse angle) at length meet with this PL, or XL, regard
being had to the secant, or incident AP; which is mani-
festly absurd (against Eu. Ι. 17) if we regard the secant,
or incident AX.

PROOF. For anyhow two angles
of this triangle‚ as suppose at the
points A and C, will be acute (Eu. A ο c
I. 17). Wherefore the perpendic- Fig. 13.

ular, let fall from the apex of the
remaining angle B upon AC, will cut AC (Eu. Ι. 17)
in some intermediate point D.
If therefore the three angles of this triangle ABC
are supposed equal to two right angles, it follows that
