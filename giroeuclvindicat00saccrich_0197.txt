joining point A with this higher point will make with
AB a greater angle than angle BAP.

And so ever without any intrinsic end.

Wherefore angle BAX (since indeed AX both always
approaches to ΒΧ, and meets it only at an infinite dis-
tance) will be the outside limit ot' all acute angles under
which straights produced from that point A meet the
aforesaid ΒΧ at a finite distance.

PROPOSITION XXX.

To any terniinated straiyht AB stands at riyht anyles
(fiy. 36) a certain unbounded straiyht ΒΧ. Ι say
firstly‚ that the straiyht AY, erected perpendicularly
toward the sanie parts upon AB, will be one intrinsic
lirnit of all those straiyhts, which drawn froin the

point [65] A out toward the same parts have (in the
hypothesis of acute anglie) a common perpendicular
in two distinct points with the other unbounded
straiyht ΒΧ. Ι say secondly‚ that no acute anyle
will be the rnininimn of all, produced under which
a straiyht from the aforesaid point A (in the afore-
said hypothesis) has in two distinct points a common
perpendicular with ΒΧ.

PROOF OF THE FIRST PART. For since AY has in
common at two distinct points A and B the perpendicular
