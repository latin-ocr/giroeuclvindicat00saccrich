end, that AXM with its fixed segment AX can again be
so placed in that plane as to fit the other, AXF in so far
as truly the prolongation AXF toward the right is pre-
cisely similar, or equal to the prolongation AXM toward
the left, and moreover the prolongation AXF toward
the left is precisely similar, or equal to the prolongation
AXM toward the right.

But since the arc BC is greater than its part [79] MF‚
and in this portion MF in like way may be designated
two other points with an interval leSS, without any certain
limit; truly one of two things must happen in this ap-
proximation of the aforesaid points,

One is, if at length is attained one and the same
intermediate point D, to which if XD is joined, such a
prolongation AXD is obtained, as alone is such as to be
wholly similar, or equal to itself (comparison made be-
tween the left and the right side).

The other is, if two such distinct points M, and F are
found, to which XM, and XF being joined, two prolonga-
tions arise, one AXM, and the other AXF, of which each
is, in the way just· explained, wholly similar, or equal.

But this second I prove to be impossible thus. For
from the very terms can be established, that a straight line
produced from the point A on through X, can take in
the plane only a single position, whilst obviously the
superadded XF lies altogether equally toward the left,
and toward the right side of the assumed AX, or deviates
not more toward the left, than toward the right side of
it. Therefore there will not be another prolongation
AXM, which also lies altogether equally toward the left,
and toward the right of this AX.

Obviously it holds that it cannot happen at the same
time, both that the prolongation AXF toward the right
is wholly similar, or equal to itself considered toward
the left, and that another prolongation AXM toward the
