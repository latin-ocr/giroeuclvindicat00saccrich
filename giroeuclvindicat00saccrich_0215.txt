Moreover it follows the interpretation should be the
same of the other Euclidean definition‚ in which he says
a sursace is plane, which lies evenly between its lines.

For if a surface inclosed by the aforesaid lines one
ADX straight, and another ABBX (whether this be a
simple or multiplex curved line, or be composed of two,
or several straight lines, as suppose AB, BB, ΒΧ) if,
Ι say, a sursace [73] of this sort is supposed to be revolved
about the fixed straight ADX, until the line ABX comes
to congruence with the line ACX‚ located in the opposite
part, which assuredly is in every way equal and wholly
similar to ABX, and again with the same straight ADX
incloses (toward the same part, whether upper or under)
a surface wholly equal‚ and similar to the aforesaid: one
of two things certainly happens; either one surface fits
the other completely; or between those two surfaces is
inclosed a three-dimensional space.

And indeed if the first happenS, the surface is called
plane; but if the second happens the surface is not called
plane; because then may· be supposed other intermediate
sursaoes, mutually equal, and similar, interposed between
the same extreme lineS‚ which always mutually approach
more to each other without any certain limit‚ and there-
fore even to the exclusion ot' every intermediate space.

But then each surface is called plane, because truly
it lies ex aequo between its extreme lineS‚ without any
ascent or descent into bordering parts,

LEMMA ΙΙ.

Two straight lines cannot have one and the same seyment
in common.

PRooF. For if that is possible, let one and the same
segment AX be common (fig. 38) to the two straights
