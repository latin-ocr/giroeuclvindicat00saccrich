beautiful theorems developed, grew, but did not end.

So flowered the · beauteous body of a new geometry,
mermaid-like‚ the latter portions somewhat fishy, but oh!
the elegant torSO.

Of this book says the genius Corrado Segre: “Never-
theless the first seventy pages (apart from a few isolated
phrases), up to Proposition 32 inclusive, constitute an en-
semble of logie and of geometric acumen which may be
called perfect.''
