metric, which I think the most efficacious and most simple
of all, inasmuch as it rests upon an accessible‚ most easy,
and most convenient experiment.

For if in a circle, whose center is y Q
D, are fitted (fig. 22) three straight
lines CB, BL, LA, each equal to the A c

radius DC, and it is ascertained that Figl.) 22·

the join AC goes through the center
D, this will be sufficient for demonstrating the assertion.

For, DB, DL being joined, we will have three tri-
angleS‚ which (from Eu. I. 8 and 5) not only will be
equiangular to one another, but also singly for themselves.
Therefore since the three angles together at the point D,
indeed ADL, LDB, BDC are equal (by Eu. I. 13) to
two right angles ; also the three angles together of each
of these triangles will be equal to two right angleS‚ as
suppose of the triangle BDC. Wherefore (from P. XV.)
will be established hence the hypothesis of right angle;
and consequently (from the already admitted P. XIII.)
that postulate will be demonstrated.

But if, before all attempt whether at demonstration
or at graphic exhibition‚ one wishes to compare inter se
those two postulateS, I grant indeed the Euclidean may
appear more obscure or even liable to objection. But
after the graphic exhibition which I reserve for Scholion
IV following, it will appear vice versa that the Euclidean
postulate indeed can retain the dignity and name of postu-
late, but the other ought rather to be reckoned among the
theoremS.

But here I must explain (as a little above I have prom-
ised I was about to do) the manifest disparity in this
relation between the circular line and the straight line.
Now the disparity arises from this; that a line is called
straight in reference to itself; but is called circular‚ as
suppose (fig. 23) MDHNM‚ not in reference to itself,
