right angleS, is established respectively the hypothesis of
right angle, or obtuse angle, or acute angle.

COROLLARY.

Hence, any two opposite sides oi the premised quadri-
lateral being produced toward the same parm, as suppose
AD to H, and BC to M ; the two external angles HDC,
MCD will be ( Eu. Ι. 13) either equal t0‚ or leSS‚ or
greater than the two internal' and opposite angles together
at the points A, and Β, according as is true the hypothesis
of right angle, or obtuse angle, or acute angle.

PROPOSITION XVII.

If the straiyht ΑΗ stands (fio. 15) at riyht angles to
any certain arbitrarily small straiyht AB: I say that
in the hypothesis of acute anyle it cannot hold qood,
that every straiyht BD, making with ΑΒ toward the
parts of this ΑΗ any acute anyle K
you choose, will at length meet

this AH produced at a finite, or

terminated distance.

PROOF. Join ΗΒ. The angle ABH n D
will be acute (Eu. Ι. 17) because of
the right angle at the point A. Now
draw' (Eu. I. 23) HD toward [24] the
parts of the point Β, which not cut—
ting the angle AHB makes with this ΗΒ an acute angle
equal to this acute angle ABH. Then from the point
B is let fall to HD the perpendicular BD, which will
fall toward the parts of the aforesaid acute angle at the
point H.

Since therefore the side ΗΒ is opposite in the triangle
HDB to the right angle at D, and likewise in the triangle
