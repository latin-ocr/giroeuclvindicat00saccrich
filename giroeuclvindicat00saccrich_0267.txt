But that the thing goes otherwise in the hypothesis of
acute angle, follows from what is said above.

From this scholion therefore and from the other after
P. XIII. may be realizedâ€š that a wholly different way
was to be taken in refuting each false hypothesiS, one of
obtuse angle, and the other of acute angle.

Moreover it is easy in like manner to recognize from
these, that it can only be a straight line CD, which in all

its points is equidistant from the assumed straight line
AB. [97]

PROPOSITION XXXIX.

I f upon two straiyht lines another straight striking makes
toward the same parts aaz-oles less than two riyht
anyles, those two straight lines produced in infinitum
meet each other toward those parts where are the
angles less than two riyht anyleS.

This is the famous Euclidean axiom, which at length
I undertake absolutely to demonstrate.

For this end however it will be sufficient to recall
some of the preceding demonstrationS. Therefore in my
propositionS, up to P. VII. inclusive, I have distinguished
three hypotheses about the straight joining the extreme
points of two equal perpendicularS, which stand upon
a certain straight, that I call base, in the same plane.

Furthermore in regard to these hypotheses (which in
turn I distinguish from the species of the angleS, which
are supposed to be made at the join) I demonstrate that
any one of them, forsooth either of right angle, or obtuse
angle, or acute angle. alone is true always and in every
case, if even in one case it be true.

Then in P. XIII. I show the universal truth of the
controverted axiom, when occurs either the hypothesis
of right angle, or of obtuse angle.
