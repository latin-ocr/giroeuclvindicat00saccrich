PROPOSITION ΙΙ.

Retainin9 the uniform quadrilateral ΑΒΕ D, bisect the
sides AB, CD (fiy. 2) in the points M and H. [2]

I say the anyles at the join c ἢ D
MH witz then be right. vv
PRO0F. Join AH, BH, and
likewise CM, DM. Δ Δ
Because in this quadrilateral A n 3
the angles A and B are taken Fig 2

equal and likewise (from the
preceding proposition) the angles C, and D are equal; it
follows (Eu. 1. 4) (noting the equality of the sides) that
in the triangles CAM, DBM, the bases CM, DM will be
equal; and likewise‚ in the triangles ACH, BDH, the
bases AH, BH.

Therefore; comparing the triangles CHM, DHM,
and in turn the triangles AMH, ΒΜΗ; it follows (Eu.
I. 8) that we have mutually equal, and therefore right,
the angles at the points M, and H.

Quod erat demonstrandum. ’

PROPOSITION III.

If two equal stra‘iyhts [sects] (fig. 3) AC, BD, stand
perpendicu-lar to any straiyht ΑΒ ; I say the join
CD will be equal to, or
IeSS, or φθαῖεν than AB,
accordiny as the anyles ²⁴
at CD are riyht‚ or ob-
tuse, or acute.

PROOF OF THE FrRs'r
PART. Each angle C, and D, Α p ῃ Β
being right; suppose, if it ,Fig. 3.
were possible, either one of those, as DC, greater than
the other BA.
