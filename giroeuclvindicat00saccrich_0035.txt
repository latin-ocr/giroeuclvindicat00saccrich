Postulate. Here* then is something worthy of Saccheri's
steel. To prove it from its own denial!

This would show that Euclid's assumption5‚ though com-
patible, were not all independent. On the other hand, the
independence of the Parallel Postulate from the other as-
sumptions would be established if it were shown to be in-
demonstrable from thern even with the help of its own con-
tradictory opposite, that is, even by means of Saccheri’s
darling type, IX—IZ.

To get this negative in convenient form, Saccheri uses
for it an equivalent, employing a figure found in his ClaviuS‚
1574, and again in Giordano Vitale da Bitonto‚ in his Euclide
restituto overo qli* antichi elementi yeometrici ristaurati, e
facilitati. LibriX V. Roma. fol„ 1680; and in both works pre-
cisely in discussion of this very matter. The figure is the
isosceles bi-rectangular quadrilateral. Its other two angles
are equal. To assume one right is, with Euclid's other as-
sumptionS‚ equivalent to the parallel postulate, whose nega-
tive therefore is to assume one oblique. Armed then with
this form of its denial as an addition to the other Euclidean
assumptions‚ Saccheri sallies forth to the stay, steeled for
victory or defeat—but not for the wholly unexpected and to
him inexplicable compound of victory and defeat which he
met.

His negation breaks into two equal partS. The angle
assumed oblique is either obtuse or acute. If it be obtuse,
he easily achieves his accustomed victory: he proves the
Parallel Postulate. If it be acute, this twin will not win.

Why? We know. Saccheri never did.

Besides the Archimedes assumption, Euclid, and every
one else for more than a century after Saccheri. assumes
that the straight line is of infinite length. These assumptions
nullify the possibility of a pair of obtuse angles in a bi-
rectangular isosceles quadrilateral‚ and to that extent prove
the “hypothesis of right angle‚'’ which is then equivalent to
the Parallel Postulate. But they are no obstacle to this pair
of angles being acute.

Had there been some other unconscious assumption of
