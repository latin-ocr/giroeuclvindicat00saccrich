quadrilateral KTSK are greater than any sum ot‘ angleS,
which lacks however little you choose of being four right
angles; since already it has been shown that a quadri-
lateral KHLK can always be designated such [54] that
its four angles together shall fall short of four rights
by less than any assignable part of a right. Therefore
the four angles together of this stable and given quadri-
lateral either are equal to four rights‘or greater.

But then (from P. XVI.) is established the hypoth-
esis either of right angle or of obtuse angle; and there-
fore (from Propp. V. and VI.) the hypothesis of acute
angle is destroyed.

So is established that the hypothesis of acute angle
will be destroyed, it‘ two straights existing in the same
plane so approach each other mutually ever more, that
nevertheless their distance is always greater than any
assigned length.

Hoc autem erat demonstrandum.

COROLLARY I.

But (the hypothesis of acute angle destroyed) the
controverted Euclidean postulate is manifest from P.

XIII.; just as in Scholion ΠΙ. after P. XXI„ where we

spoke of the attempt of the Arab Nasiraddin‚ I promised
would be disclosed by me in this place.

COROLLARY ΙΙ.

On the other hand from this proposition, and from

ἦ the preceding P. XXIII. is manifestly gathered that the

two following points are not sufficient for establishing
Euclidean geometry. One is: that we designate by the
name of parallels those straightS‚ which existing in the

same plane possess a common perpendicular. The second
indeed, that all straights existing in the same plane, of
