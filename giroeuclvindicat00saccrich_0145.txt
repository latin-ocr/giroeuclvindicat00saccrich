the internal and opposite angle (which then would be-
come) AHG, or GHA.

Therefore I have rightly supposed the side DF of
one triangle to be less-than the side AC of the other
triangle, in accordance with the hypothesis now es-
tablished.

Wherefore from any two triangles mutually equian-
gular‚ but not also mutually equilateral, the Euclidean
postulate is established. Quod intendebatur.

SCHOLION IV.

In which is expounded on a figure a certain consideration
on which Euclid probably thouyht‚ in order to estab-
lish that postulate of his as per se evident.

I premise first: within any acute angle BAX (fig. 12)
can be drawn from any [42] point X of AX a certain
straight XB, under any designated (even obtuse) angle
R (provided only that R with the acute BAX falls short
of two right angles) ; I say, a certain XB can be drawn,
which at a finite remove meets AB in a certain point B.

 

For just that Ι have already demonstrated in a scho-
lion after P. XIII.

I premise secondly: these AB, AX (fig. 25) can be
understood as produced in infinitum even to certain points
Y, and Z; and likewise the aforesaid XB (produced in

infinitum even to a point Y) can be understood to be
