EUCLID’S ELEMENTS, BOOK IX, PROPOSITION 12.

I f there be how many numbers soever in continued propor-
tion from unity: Then whatever prime numbers measure
the last, the same will also measure that next after the
unit.

Let there be as many numbers as we please, A, B, C, D
continual proportionals from unity; I say whatever prime
numbers measure D will measure A a150.

Unity A Β C D
For example, 1 4 16 64 256
E H G F
2 8 32 128

For let some prime number E measure D; I say E
measures A.

For suppose it does not.

Now E is prime, and a prime number is prime to any it
does not measure [VII. 29] ; therefore E, A are prime to
one another.

And since E measures D, let it measure it by the units
in F; therefore E multiplying F produces D.

Again, since A measures D by the units in C [IX. 11 and
Porism],⁶ therefore A multiplying C produces D. But E
has also by multiplying F made D 3 whence the product of
A, C is equal to the product of E, F.

Therefore, as A to E, so is F to C [VII. 19].

But A, E are prime; primes are also least [VII. 21]‚⁰
and the least measure those which have the same ratio the
same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and
the consequent the consequent [VII. 20] ; therefore E meas-
ures C.

Let it measure it by G ; then E multiplying G produces

C. But A has also by multiplying B made C [IX. 11 and
Porist.

ὓ x”*¹¹ = x¹¹¹ κ’.

⁶“Numbers prime to one another are the least of those which
have the same ratio as they.”
