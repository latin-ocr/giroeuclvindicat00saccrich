is let fall to ΑΗ produced. I say hence will be
established the hypothesis of right misse, or obtuse

anyle, or acute angle, accordiny as the *portion ΗΒ ’

is equa! to, [27] or φθαῖεν, or less than AH.

PROOF. For the join DB will be (Eu. Ι. 4, and P. X.
of this) either equal to, or greater, or less than AD, or
DC, according as the portion ΗΒ
is equal to, or greater, or less than

And first indeed let ΗΒ be equal
to AH, so that therefore the join
DB may be equal to AD, or DC. It
follows that the circumference of
the circle, which is described with
the center D and radius DB, will
go through the points A and C. Therefore the angle
ABC, which is assumed right, is in this semicircle, whose
diameter is AC. Wherefore (from the preceding propo-
sition) ,is established the hypothesis of right angle.

Quod erat primo loco demonstrandum.

Secondly let BH be greater than AH, so that there-
fore the join DB is greater than AD, or DC. It follows
that the circumference of the circle, which is described
with center D, and radius DA, or DC, will meet DB in
some intermediate point K. Therefore, AK, and CK
being joined, the angle AKC will be obtuse, because
greater (Eu. Ι. 21) than the angle ABC, which is as-
sumed right. WVherefore (from the preceding proposi-
tion) is established the hypothesis of obtuse angle.

Quod erat secundo loco demonstrandum.

Thirdly let BH be less than AH, so that therefore
the join DB is less than AD, or DC. It follows that the
circumference of the circle, which is described with cen-
ter D, and radius DA, or DC, will meet in some point M
