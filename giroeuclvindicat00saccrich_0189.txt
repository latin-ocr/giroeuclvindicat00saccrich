greater (even in the hypothesis of acute angle) than

any assigned finite length, as for instance the aforesaid
base AB.

This standing; assume in ΒΧ (fig. 35) a certain BT
equal to CN, and erect from the point T toward AX the
perpendicular TS, which obviously (from Scholion after
P. XXIV.) meets AX in a certain point S. Then from
the point S let fall. to AB the perpendicular SQ.

This falls (because of Eu. I. 17) toward the parts of
the acute angle SAR between the points A and Β. Again‚
acute will be the angle QST in the quadrilateral QSTR
since the remaining three angles are right3 else (against
Propp. V. and VI.) we come upon the hypothesis either
of right angle or of obtuse angle.

Hence the straight SQ will be greater (from Cor. Ι.
to P. ΙΙΙ.) than the straight BT, or CN; and again the
angle ASQ will be greater than the excess by which the
obtuse angle AST exceeds a right angle, and thus greater
than the angle MNC. Draw therefore a certain SF cut-
ting AQ in F and making with SA an angle equal to
MNC. Then from the point A draw to SF produced
the perpendicular AO. The point O falls (from Eu.

I. 17) below the point F, since the angle AFS (by Eu.
Ι. 16) is obtuse.
