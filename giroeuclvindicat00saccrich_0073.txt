hand the angle BXH is obtuse ; and, on the other, if XM
be joined, the angle BXM (Eu. Ι. 17) is acute. Then
however, since the quadrilateral XBMP contains three
right angleS, from what has just now been noted, and
one obtuse (Eu. I. 16) at the point P, because it is exter—
nal in relation to the internal and opposite 'right angle at

the point H of the triangle PHX; the side XP will be ·

(Cor. I., P. III.) less than the opposite ΒΜ. Wherefore,
assuming in ΒΜ the portion BF equal to this XP, the
angles at the join PF will be (P. Ι.) mutually equal.
certainly obtuse, since the angle BFP (Eu. I. 16) is ob-
tuse because of the right angle interior and opposite
FMP. Therefore the hypothesis of obtuse angle abides
for any base ΒΧ.

But, as above, this hypothesis abides for this base
ΒΧ, however much the equal perpendiculars are aug-
mented or diminished at will. Therefore it holds, that
if even in a single case the hypothesis of obtuse angle
is true, always in every case it alone is true.

Quod erat demonstrandum.

PROPOSITION VII.

If even in a single case the hypothesis of acute anyle
is true, always in every case it alone is true.

PROOF is very easily given. For if the hypothesis of
acute angle should permit any case of either other hypoth-
esis, either of right angle, or of obtuse angle, now (from
the two preceding [10] propositions) no place would be left
for the hypothesis of acute angle, which is absurd.

Therefore if even in a single case the hypothesis οἱ
acute angle is true, always in every case it alone is true.

Quod erat demonstrandum.
