That cannot, Ι say, be objected ; since from this itself
Ι shall demonstrate, after P. XXV„ the meeting at a finite
distance of all such straightS, in accordance with the
Euclidean postulate.

Now Ι go over to the aforesaid John Wallis, wh0‚ as
made a custom with so many great men, ancient as well
as recent, and on the other hand from the obligation im-
posed on his Oxford professional chair, [40] determined
to undertake this same duty of demonstrating the oft men-
tioned postulate.

Now solely he assumes as if certain, what follows:
namely that to any given figure another similar of any
maynitude is possible.

And that this indeed may be presumed of any figure
(although in his affair he assumes solely a rectilineal tri-
angle) is well argued from the circle, Which of course all
admit can be described with any-sized radius,

Further the acute man observes most cautiously it
does not thwart this his presumption‚ that besides the
equality of corresponding angles also the proportionality
of all corresponding sides is required, in order that a
rectilineal figure, for example a triangle‚ may be similar
to another rectilineal triangle; though still the definition
of proportion, and forthwith of similar figures‘are to be
taken from the Fifth‚ and the Sixth Books of Euclid: For
(says he himself) Euclid could have put each in front of
the First Book.

Hereafter, this standing (which nevertheless can be
denied by any one, unless it is demonstrated) the famous
man carries out his intent with really beautiful and in-
genious effort.

But I am unwilling to fail in anything to the charge
undertaken by me.

Therefore I assume two triangleS, one ABC, and the
other DEF (fig. 24) mutually equiangular. Ι (10 not
