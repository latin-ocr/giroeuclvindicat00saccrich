in which in form of a problem he teacheS, and demon-
strates the description from a qiven straiyht line, of the
square as defined by him.

In the same way therefore Euclid ought not to be
blamed, because he defined parallel straight lines in this
manner, since he nowhere assumes them as given for the
construction of any problem, except after Prop. 31 of the
First Book, in which as a problem he demonstrateS‚ how
should be drawn from ayiven point without a given straight
line a straight line parallel to this, and indeed according to
the definition of parallels given by him, so that produced
indeed into the infinite on neither side do they meet one
another. And what is more ; he demonstrates this with-
out any dependence from the postulate here controverted.
Thus Euclid demonstrates without any petitio principii
that there can be found in nature two such straiyht lines,
which (lying in the same plane) protracted on each side
into the infinite never rneet, and therefore makes clearly
known to us that relation by which he defines parallel
straight lines,

Let us continue onward‚ whither the scrupulous ac-
cuser ot' Euclid invites us. Parallel straight lines he calls
