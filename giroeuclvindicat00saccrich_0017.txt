Philip Kelland, Cambridge Senior Wrangler‚ says: “It
is certain that from its completeneSS‚ uniformity and fault-
lessneSS, from its arrangement and progressive character,
and from the universal adoption of the completest and best
line of argument, Euclid's Elements stands preeminently at
the head of all human productions, In no science, in no
department of knowledge, has anything appeared like this
work. For upward of two thousand years it has commanded
the admiration of mankind.’'

For two millenniums Euclid’s axioms and postulates re-
mained undoubted. Before Saccheri‚ no one had even for
a moment thought of contradicting any of them. But Sac-
cheri set forth two propositionS, >each a flat contradiction
of Euclid's most famous postulate, the fifth (Heath), then
call-ed Axiom 13 (Clavius), afterward Axiom 12 (Simson)‚
and Axiom 11 (John Bolyai). These two new monsterS‚
hypotheses of his own creating‚ he attacked.

Euclid from the beginning builds consciously upon the
assumption: Two points determine a straight. He also
uses the Archimedes assumption, and the assumption that
every straight, besides being unbounded, divides the plane
into two partS, is open, infinite. With the aid of these
assumptionS‚ Saccheri disposes of his first monster, the
hypothesis anyuli obtusi.

It was not real death, however, but a magician's trance
that lasted more than a century. Finally freed from the
spell by the trumpet call of geniUS, it ariseS‚ a benignant
fairy‚ and to—day gives us Pure SphericS, deduced from a
set of assumptions which give' no parallels‚ >no similar figureS,
but double the value of much⁴ of our plane geometry by
interpreting it as spherics also, by showing how it holds good
as spherics, can be read off as spherics and used as sph-erics
also. Thus drafts from Euclid have become payable twice
over.

But apart from his Postulate V, all Euclid's assump-
tionS, conscious and unconsciouS, fail Saccheri in his lengthy

battle, “diuturnum proelium adversus hypothesin 'anyuli
acuti.”
