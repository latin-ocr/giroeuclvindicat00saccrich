But if however the angle CAD‚ or its vertical XAH,
be leSS, or greater than the internal or opposite ADB;
also the join CD will be (Eu. I. 24) less or greater than
AB ; and therefore (P. IV.) will be true respectively the
hypothesis of obtuse angle, or acute angle. ’

Quae omnia erant demonstranda.

PROPOSITION IX.

In any riyht-anyled trianyle the two acute anyles re-
maining are, take-n together, equa-l to one riyht magde,
in the hypothesis of right anyle,· φθαῖεν than one
riyht angle, in the hypothesis of obtuse anyle,· but
less in the hypothesis of acute anyle.

PROOF. For if the angle XAH (fig. 7) is equal to
the angle ADB, which is certain from the preceding
proposition in the hypothesis of right angle, then the
angle ADB makes up with the angle HAD two right
angleS‚ as (Eu. Ι. 13) the aforesaid angle XAH makes
them up with this angle HAD. Wherefore, the right
angle HAB being subtracted, the two angles ADB and
BAD remain together equal to one right angle.

Quod erat primum.

However, if the angle XAH is less than the angle
ADB, which is certain from the preceding proposition
in the hypothesis of obtuse angle, then the angle ADB
makes up with the angle HAD more than two right
angleS, since with it (Eu. Ι. 13) the angle XAH makes
up two. Wherefore, the angle HAB being subtracted,

the two angles ADB and BAD will be together greater
than one right angle.

Quod erat secundum.

Finally, if the angle XAH be greater than the angle
ADB, which is certain from the preceding proposition
in the hypothesis of acute angle, then the angle ADB will
make up less than two right angles with the angle HAD,
