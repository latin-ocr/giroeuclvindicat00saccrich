indeed point D pertaining to that semicircumference
comes to congruence with point A, so that moreover
point B, the other extreme point of the same semicircum-
ference comes to congruence with point C.

This abiding; if in the semicircumference BLD is
designated any point L, to which in the described straight
line BA corresponds point Μ, from which in that plane
is erected the perpendicular MK, equal to BD: Ι say that
point K will be the point H diametrically opposite the
point L.

For there in the point M, or L the straight AB
touches the aforesaid circle. Therefore MK perpendicu-
lar to AB will go (from Eu. III. 19, which is assuredly
independent of the controverted axiom) through the
center of the same circle. Wherefore; where point L in
that revolution of the circle BLDH comes to congruence
with the point M of AB, also point H, diametrically oppo-
site the aforesaid point L, falls upon point K of MK.

Furthermore it is certain the same holds in like manner
of the remaining points of the semicircumference BLD,
and of those diametrically correlative in the other semicir-
cumference BHD. Wherefore the line, in that way succes-
sively described by the points of the semicircumference
BHD, will be the already considered DKC‚ which in all
its points is equidistant from the straight BA ; and which
therefore ζ in accordance with the hypothesis of acute
angle) is always concave toward the side of AB.

But thence follow5, that the point M in BA may be
considered exactly equal to point K in DKQ because of
[94] their equality in every way with the points L, and H
diametrically opposite in the circle BLDH.

Wherefore ; since the same holds of all points of the
described straight BA, if they be compared with the other
uniformly opposite in the aforesaid assumed curve DKC;
the consequence evidently is, that this curve, born of the
