dicular NK let fall to ΒΧ isless than any assigned length,
as suppose than ΤΒ. But then is assumed in ΤΒ a por-
tion CB equal to NK and CN is joined. In the hypothesis
of acute angle, it is known that the angle NCB will be
acute. Therefore (from Eu. I. 13) NCT, which is the
adjacent angle, will be obtuse.

Therefore the straight, which is erected toward the
parts of AX perpendicularly from the point T (disposed
between the points A and C), does not meet (from Eu.
I. 17) CN at any point; and therefore (lest it should
inclose a space with AT, or with TC) it strikes the ter-
minated AN in some point F.

Therefore even in the hypothesis of acute angle (which
we know can here alone hinder) there will be in this
AB no assignable point T, from which the perpendicular
erected toward the parts of AX does not, at a finite or

terminated distance, meet this AX in a certain point F.

Α But thence follows, that, point M being assumed in
AB produced, from which is erected toward the parts of
the points X a perpendicular MZ, this cannot, even if
infinitely produced, meet the aforesaid AX; because other-
wise that other straight ΒΧ must (from the foregoing
demonstration) at a finite distance meet this AX3 which
is against the present hypothesis,

COROLLARY ΙΙ.

From which again it follow5, that every perpendicular,
erected from any point (but not however infinitely re-
moved) of this AB produced indefinitely‚ must at a
finite distance meet the aforesaid AX, as soon as indeed
it is assumed that every such perpendicular ever more,
