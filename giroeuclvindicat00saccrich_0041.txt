Of all who have learned mathematiCS, none can fail
to know how great is the excellence and worth of Euclid’s
Elements.' As erudite witnesses here I summon Archi-
medes, ApolloniUS‚ TheodosiuS‚ and others almost in·-
numerable‚ writers on mathematics even to our timeS.
who use Euclid’s Ele-ments as foundation long established
and wholly unshaken. But this so great celebrity has not
prevented many, ancients as well as modernS‚ and among
them distinguished geometerS‚ maintaining they had
found certain blemishes in these most beauteous nor ever
sufficiently praised ElementS. Three such flecks they des—
ignate, which now I name.

The first pertains to the definition of parallels and
with it the axiom which in Clavius is the thirteenth of
the First Book, where Euclid says:

I f a straiyht line falliny on two straiyht lines, lyiny
in the same plane, make with them two internal anyles
toward the same parts less than two riyht anyles, these

No one doubts the truth of this proposition; but solely
