cipii clearly to demonstrate the disputed Euclidean axiom.
Therefore never will I use from those prior propositions
of Euclid’s First Book, not merely the twenty-seventh
or the twenty-eighth‚ but not even the sixteenth or the
seventeenth‚ except where clearly it is question of a tri-
angle every [xi] way restricted.

Then in the Second Part for a new confirmation of
the same axiom‚ Ι shall demonstrate that the line which
at all its points is equidistant from an assumed straight
line can only be a straight line. But every one sees that
on this occasion the very first principles of all geometry
are to be subjected to a rigid examination.

I go on to the other two blemishes charged against
Euclid. The first pertains to the sixth definition of the
Fifth Book about proportionals; the second to the fifth
definition of the Sixth Book about the composition of
rati05. It will be the sole aim of my Second Book to
clearly expound the Euclidean definitions mentioned, and
at the same time to show that Euclid's fame is here un—
justly attacked.

Yet again it is well to state that on this occasion I
shall prove a certain axiom that may safely be applied
throughout the whole of geometry, without need of that
postula-te, put in (as I believe) by commentators under
the name of axiom, whose use begins at the eighteenth
proposition ot' the Fifth Book. [xii]
