’ other way retain its arbitrary prolongation, while its part

XB is supposed to be transferred through new and new
positions even to fitting XC in that one plane, the portion
AX remaining meanwhile in the same place; I say it
cannot retain its chosen continuation, except in so far
as the portion XB is understood to ascend, or to descend
to be with the fixed AX in new, and new planeS, until
it returns to the old plane, fitting there the aforesaid
XC. [77]

For this may be adjudged already demonstrated ; be-
cause obviously no position in that same plane can be found,
at which AXB , (the portion AX remaining in its place)
retains its chosen prolongation, except where it comes to
congruence with the aforesaid AXC.

I say fourthly: in the arc BC such a point D can be
designated that, if XD be joined, then this AXD not only
is a straight line, but moreover it lies So, that the pro-
longation AXD, considered toward the left, is wholly
equal, or similar to the same prolongation considered
toward the right.

PROOF. The first part (whatever be the point D
designated in the arc BC) is shown by the method used
above in regard to the prolongation AXM.

But the second part is proved thus. We suppose here
two straights AXB, AXC with the same common segment
AX. Further we suppose the prolongation AXB toward the
left not to be wholly similar, or equal to the same prolonga-
tion toward the right; because, such a complete similitude

or equality holding good, it is easily shown that segment
AX can be common to no other straight line, just as we

shall demonstrate os the prolongation AXD. Finally in
consequence we suppose the prolongation AXB may so
