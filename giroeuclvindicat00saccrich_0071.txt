ST equal to this AB. But that this is absurd in the pres-
ent hypothesis follows so; because thus (P. IV.) we have
a ca'se for the hypothesis of right angle, which (P. V.)
would leave· no place for the hypothesis of obtuse angle*
Therefore the angles at the join RX must be obtuse.

Then‚ equal portions AL, ΒΚ being assumed in Ac,
BD; in a similar manner we show the angles at the join
LK cannot be acute toward this AB; because thus it
would be greater than AB, and still more therefore
greater than the sect CD. But here would be found, as
above, a certain intermediate between CD leSS, and LK
greater than this AB; an intermediate‚ I say, equal to ΑΒ
itself‚ which certainly, from what was just now observed,
would take away every place for the hypothesis of obtuse
angle.

Finally from this very cause the angles at the join
LK cannot be right 3 therefore they will be obtuse.

Therefore with the same base AB, 'the perpendiculars
being increased or diminished at will, the hypothesis of
obtuse angle will always persist.

But the same ought to be demonstrated for any as-
sumed base.

Let there be chosen (fig. 6) for ν’

Let AB, RX be bisected in the C y n

MH will be (P. II.) perpendicular to L-

Make therefore the right angle BXP toward the parts
of this MH. XP will meet MH itself in some point P
situated between the points M and H ; since on the one
