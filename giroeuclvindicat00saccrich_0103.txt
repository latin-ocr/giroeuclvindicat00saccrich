PROPOSITION XVI.

By any quadrilateral ABCD, of which the four anyles
toyether are equal to, or meatem or less than four
riyht anyles, is established respectively the hypothesis
of riyht anyle, or obtuse anyle, or acute angle.

PROOF. Join AC. The three angles of the triangle
ABC (fig. 14) will not be together equal to, or greater,
or less than two right angles.

without the three angles of the “R'‘s‘sssss'n ss
triangle ADC being themselves RN

also together respectively equal qum-*q
to, or greater, or less than two

right angleS, lest obviously (by Η Fig 14 Μ
the preceding) from one of ’ ’

those triangles be established one hypothesi5‚ and another
from the other, against the fifth, sixth, and seventh prop-
ositions of this work.

This holding good: If the four angles together of the
premised quadrilateral are equal to four right angleS, it
follows that the three angles together of either of the
just mentioned triangles will be equal to two right angles,
and therefore (from the preceding) [23] the hypothesis
of right angle will be established.

But if indeed the four angles of this quadrilateral be
together greater, or less than four right angle5‚ similarly
the three angles together of those triangles should be
respectively either at the same time greater, or at the same
time less than two right angles. Wheret'ore from these
triangles would be established respectively (from the pre-
ceding) either the hypothesis of obtuse angle, or the hy-
pothesis of acute angle.

Therefore by any quadrilateral‚ of which the four
angles together are equal to, or greater, or less than four
