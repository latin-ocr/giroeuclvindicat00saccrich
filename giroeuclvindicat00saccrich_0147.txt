so moved above this AZ toward the parts of the point Z,
that the angleat the point X toward the parts of the
point A is always equal to the certain given obtuse
angle R. .

Ι premise thirdly: that Euclidean postulate would be
liable now to no doubt, if the aforesaid XY in this how-
ever great motion above the straight AZ cuts always
that AY in certain points B, H, D, P, and so successively
in other points more remote from this point A

The reason is evident; since thus any two straights
AB, XH lying in the same plane, upon which any straight
AX cutting makes two angles toward the same parts
BAX, HXA‚ less than two right angleS‚ must at length
meet toward those parts in one and the same point H.

I premise fourthly: likewise will be no doubt about
the truth of the preceding hypothetical assumption, if
the later external angles YHD, YDP and so any other
succeeding oneS, either always are equal to the preceding
external angle YBD, or at least always will be not so
much less but that any one of them always will be greater
than any little designated acute angle K. For, this hold-
ing, it is manifest that this XY in that however great mo-
tion of its toward the parts of the point Z, never will cease
to cut the aforesaid AY; which assuredly (from the pre-
ceding remark) is sufficient for establishing [43] the con-
troverted postulate.

Solely therefore remainS, that some adversary may
say those external angles at greater and greater distance
from the point A may become always less without any

« determinate limit.

But thence would follow, that XY in its motion above
the straight AZ would at length meet AY in a certain
point P without any angle with the segment PY‚ so that
indeed a segment of the two straights APY, and, XPY
