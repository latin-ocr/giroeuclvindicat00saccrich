so of course follows as absolutely true, that the distance
of one from the other of the aforesaid straightS, if they
be produced in infinitum, is greater than any finite assign-
able length.

SCHOLION Ι.

In which is weiyhed the endeavor of ProcluS.

After the theorems so far demonstrated by me, inde-
pendently of the Euclidean postulate, toward an exact
proof of which they all conspire; in my judgment it is
well if I diligently weigh the labors of certain well-
known geometers in the same endeavor. [30]

Ι begin from ProcluS‚ of whom Clavius in the Ele·
ments, after I. 28, gives the following assumption:

If from a point two straiyht lines makiny an angle
are produced infinitely‚ their distance will exceed every
finite magnitude.

But Proclus demonstrates indeed (as Clavius there
well remarks) that two straights (fig. 20) as suppose
AH, AD going out from the

same point A toward the same A Η
parm, always diverge the more Ι Ξ
from each other, the greater the b ἓ

distance from the point A, but Fig, 20.

not also that this distance in-

creases beyond every finite limit that may be designated‚
as was requisite for his purpose.

In which place the aforesaid Clavius cites the example
of the Conchoid of NicomedeS‚ which going out from
the same point A as the straight AH toward the same
partS‚ so recedes always more from it, that nevertheless
only at an infinite productiori is their distance equal to a
certain finite sect AB standing perpendicular to AH and
BC produced in infinitum toward the same partS. Why
