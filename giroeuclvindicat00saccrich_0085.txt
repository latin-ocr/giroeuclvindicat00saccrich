But it is evident this cannot happen, except after the
meeting of the prolonged AD with PL in some point L.

For if the point T occurred before that meeting, the
perpendicular TR must cut PL in some point K. But
then in the triangle KPR would be found two right angles
at the points P and R; which is absurd (against Eu. Ι.
17).

Therefore it holds that the straights AD, PL meet
each other mutually (in the hypothesis of right angle)
in some point (and indeed at a finite or terminated dis-
tance) if they be produced toward that side, on which
with the transversal ΑΡ (of finite length as great as
you choose) they make two angles together less than two
right angleS.

Quod erat demonstrandum. [15]

PROPOSITION XII.

Ayain I say also in the hypothesis of obtuse angle the
straiyht AD will meet the straiyht PL somewhere
toward those parts (and indeed at a finite, or termi-
nated distance).

PROOF. For, as in the preceding proposition, DF
being assumed equal to AD, and the just noted perpen-
diculars let fall, I must show the join DM will be greater
than DF, or DA, and therefore (P. X.) the straight ΒΜ
will be greater than AB.

And in the first place DM will not be equal to DF .
Otherwise the angle DMF would be equal (Eu. Ι. 5) to
