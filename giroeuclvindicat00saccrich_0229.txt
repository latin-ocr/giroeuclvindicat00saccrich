left (which, from its very position, is less than the pro-
longation AXF toward the same left) again is equal to
the same continuation toward the right, which truly,
again from its very position, is greater than the afore-
said prolongation AXF toward the same right.

Therefore in the arc BC cannot be found two such
points M, and F, that the joins XM, and XF, present
two prolongationS, one AXM, and the other AXF, of
which [80] each is to itself‚ in the way just explained,
wholly similar, or equal.

Whence at length follows, that somewhere must be
attained one and the same point D, to which the join XD

presents such a prolongation AXD, that to it alone be· ·

longs to be wholly similar, or equal to itselt‘ (comparison
made between left, and right side).

Quod erat hoc loco demonstrandum.

At length Ι say fifthly: this AXD alone is a straight
line, namely from A through X directly continued on
to D.

For though the phrase ex aequO, in the definition of
the straight line, should primarily be applied to points
intermediate in relation to its extreme points; whence in
particular we have just deduced‚ two straiyht lines do
not inclose a space, nevertheless it should also be under-
stood ot' the direct prolongation of this straight line.

Therefore alone this AD (lying in the same plane
with AX) is said to be the straiyht prolongation (or
in a straiyht) ot' the aforesaid AX, when that deviates
neither toward the left, nor toward the right side of it,
but from each side proceeds ex aequm so that the pro-
longation AXD is toward the left clearly similar, or

equal to the same prolongation considered toward the ι

right. For thence it w‘ill follow, that alone to AXD
pertains that another position cannot be taken by it in
the plane, while AX is fixed; when truly (from what
