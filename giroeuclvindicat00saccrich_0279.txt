PAGE 21. Prop. III: Euclid's first two postulates are:

Let it be granted,

1. that one and only one sect can be drawn from any
point to any other;

2. and that this sect may be produced continually on its
straight.

In I. 16 he assumes that the straight divides the plane
into two separate regionS‚ and also the Archimedes assump-
tion that the straight is infinite and open. This block of
assumptions is incompatible with the hypothesis of obtuse
angle as Saccheri later shows. If it were also incompatible
with the hypothesis of acute angle, we should have a perfect
case of Saccheri’s favorite method. The proofs would be
fairy proofs leading to a direct demonstration of their con-
tradictory opposite; and none of them could make part of a
modern treatise on non-Euclidean geometry.

But since Euclid's assumptions, barring the Parallel Pos-
tulate, are perfectly compatible with the hypothesis of acute
angle, many of Saccheri's proofs remain the most elegant
and cogent the world possesses in the domain of non-
Euclidean geometry.

PAGE 27. Prop. III, Cor. II: Saccheri simply cites this
corollary when, as often, he wishes the proposition: In any
birectangular quadrilateral HMPC with angle P obtuse and
angle C acute, side PM < CH.

To this the proof of Prop. III, Part 3, applieS.
