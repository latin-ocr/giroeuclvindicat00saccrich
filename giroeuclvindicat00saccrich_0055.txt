EUCLID FREED OF EVERY FLECK.

BOOK I.

IN WHICH IS PROVED: ANY TWO COPLANAR STRAIGHT
LINES, FALLING UPON WHICI-I. ANY STRAIGHT MAKES
TOWARD THE SAME PARTS TWO INTERNAL ANGLES
LESS THAN Two RIGHT ANGLES, AT LENGTH MEET
EACH OTHER TOWARD THOSE PARTS, IF INFINITELY
PRODUCED.

PART Ι.

PROPOSITION I.

If two equal straights [sects] (fiy. 1) AC, BD, make
with the straiyht AB angles equal toward the same
parts: I say that the anyles at C

the join CD will be mutually v D

equal.

PROOF. Join AD, CB. Then >·⁴
consider the triangles (ΖΑΒ, DBA.

It follows (Eu. I. 4) that the bases Α 1:531, ¹⁵

CB, AD will be equal.

Then consider the triangles ACD, BDC. It follows
(Eu. Ι. 8) that the angles ACD, BDC will be equal.
