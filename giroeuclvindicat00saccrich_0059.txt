Take in DC the piece DK equal to BA, and join AK.
Since therefore on BD stand perpendicular the equal
straights BA, DK, the angles BAK, DKA will be equal
(P. I.). But this is absurd; since the angle BAK is by
construction less than the assumed right angle BAC ; and
the angle DKA is by construction external, and therefore
(Eu. I. 16) greater than the internal and opposite DCA,
which is supposed right. Therefore neither of the afore-
said straightS, DC, BA, is greater than the other, whilst
the angles at the join CD are right; and therefore they
are mutually equal.

Quod erat primo loco demonstrandum. [3]

PROOF oF THE SECOND PART. But if the angles at
the join CD are obtuse, bisect AB, and CD, in the points
M, and H, and join MH.

Since therefore on the straight MH stand perpendicu-
lar (P. ΙΙ.) the two straights AM, CH, and at the join
AC is a right angle at A, the straight CH will not be
(P. I.) equal to this AM, since a right angle is lacking
at C.

But neither will it be greater: otherwise in HC the
piece KH being assumed equal to this AM, the angles at
the join ΑΚ will be (P. Ι.) equal.

But this is absurd, as above. For the angle MAK is
less than a right3 and the angle HKA is (Eu. Ι. 16)
greater than an obtuse, such as the internal and opposite
HCA is supposed.

It remains therefore, that CH, whilst the angles at the
join CD are taken obtuse, is less than· this AM; and
therefore CD double the former is less than AB double
the latter.

Quod erat secundo loco demonstrandum.

PROOF OF THE THIRD PART. Finally, however, if the
angles at the join are acute, MH being constructed as be-
fore perpendicular (P. ΙΙ.), we proceed thuS. Since on
