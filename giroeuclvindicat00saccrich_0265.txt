I should still observe, that also from the hypothesis
of obtuse angle is born a certain curve CKD, but convex
[96] toward the side of the base

AB, co win be (from P. Π.) ΙΙ

perpend1cular to them; and

greater (from Cor. I. to P. III.) Α p m Q Β

than AC, BD, in the hypothesis
of obtuse angle.

Wherefore a certain portion MK of ΜΗ will be equal
to AC, or BD.

Then CK and KD being joined, and the straights
CK, AM, ΜΒ, KD bisected in the points X, P, Q, N,
it follows (again from P. ΙΙ.) that the joins PX, QN
will be perpendicular to the divided straights.

But again they will be (from the same Cor. I. to P.
ΙΙΙ.) greater than AC, MK, BD.

Hence; taking of them the portions PL, ΩΒ, which
are equal to the aforesaid; we shall have a curve, born
of the hypothesis of obtuse angle, which will go through
the points C, L, K, S, D. And so on always, if we wish
to determine remaining points of the same curve.

But thence follows it will be convex toward the side
of the base ΑΒ. Now Ι grant in just the same way
could have been demonstrated the equality of this curve
with its base AB. But what good? None at all.

For just as the curve CKD must be thought, anyhow
from the common notion‚ greater than the straight CD,
so also (in P. ΙΙΙ.) the base AB is proved greater than¹
CD, when the hypothesis of obtuse angle holds. T here-

Fig. 47.

fore from this side is nothing absurd‚ if the base AB be-
equal to the aforesaid curve.
