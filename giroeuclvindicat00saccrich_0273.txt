is manifest no refutation follows hence, which therefore
only demolishes the hypothesis of acute angle.

In this place however some one perchance may inquire,
why I am so solicitous about proving exact the refutation
of each false hypothesis To the end, say I, that thence
may be more completely established that not without
cause was that famous axiom assumed by Euclid as
known per se. For chiefly this seems to be as it were
the character of every primal verity, that precisely by a
certain recondite argumentation based upon its very con-
tradictory, assumed as true, it can be at length brought
back to its own self. And I can avow that thus it has
turned out happily for me right on from early youth in
reference to the consideration of certain primal verities,
as is known from my Loyica demonstrativa.

Thence now Ι may proceed to explain, why in the
Preface to the Reader Ι have said: not without a yreat
sin ayainst riyid loyic two equidistant straight lines have
been assumed by some as yiven. [100]

Where I should point out that none of those is carped
at, whom I have mentioned even indirectly in this book
of mine, because they are truly great geometerS. and
verily free from this sin. ¹

But I say: yreat sin ayainst riyid loyic: for what else
is it to assume as given two equidistant straiyht lines:
unless either to assume ; that every line equidistant in the
same plane from a certain supposed straight line is itself
also a straight line ; or at least to suppose, that some one
thus equidistant may be a straight line, as if therefore it
were allowable to make assumption, whether by hypoth-
esi5‚ or by postulate, of any such distance of one from
another? But it is certain neither of these can be made
traffic of as if per se known.

Forsooth the objective concept of a line, which in all
its points is equidistant from a certain supposed straight
