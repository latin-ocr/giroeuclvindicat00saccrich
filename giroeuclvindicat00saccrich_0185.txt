at another place (this standing) they can admit a corn-
mon perpendicular.

For then these two AX, ΒΧ mutually approach each
other ever more, indeed either within a certain deter-
minate limit‚ as in P. XXV„ or without any certain limit‚
and therefore even to meeting, anyhow after infinite pro·
duction, as in P. XXVII.

But it holds that in either of the aforesaid cases the
destruction of the hypothesis of acute angle has now been
shown.

Quod intendebatur.

SCHOLION II.

And again this it is, that I promised at the end ot‘
Scholion IV. after P. XXI., as from the very terms
clearly appears,

SCHOLION III.

Moreover I could wish here to be observed the differss
ence between this proposition and the preceding P. XVII.
For there (recall fig. 15) has been shown the destruction
of the hypothesis of acute angle, if (the straight AB being
as small as you choose) every BD erected at whatever
acute angle, must at length meet in some point K the per-
pendicular AH produced.

But here (vice versa) in fact is permitted the desig-
nation of however most srnall an acute angle at the point
A while still the sect AB to which is to be erected the in-

definite perpendicular [60] ΒΧ, may be taken of any length
whatever.

PROPOSITION XXVIII.

If two straiyhts AX, ΒΧ (produced from any-sized
straiyht ΑΒ toward the same parts, the first under
’ an acute αηρῖε, and the other perpendicularly) mu-
