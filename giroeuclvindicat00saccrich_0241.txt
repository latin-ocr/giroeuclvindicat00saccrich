supposed exact equal DAC, and thus much less than the
angle DAM, or LHM; contrary to the hypothesis,

Then it helps nothing that angle DAF differ infinitely
little from angle DAB, or its exact equal DAC, which
again would exceed only infinitely little the angle DAM.
For always angle DAF, or LHF, will not be exactly equal
to angle DAM, or LHM, against the hypothesis.

Therefore is established that all rectilinear right an-
gles are exactly equal to one another, without any differ-
ence even infinitely small.

COROLLARY.

Thence follows that the straight line erected t‘rom a
given point of any straight perpendicularly to it in a
plane, is, in such plane, wholly unique, nor can it split
in two [86]

After the five premised lemmata, and their corollarieS, I
must now 90 on to proof of the principal objec-
tion ayainst the hypothesis of acute anyle.

Here Ι may set up, as known per se, it is not less
contradictory‚ that two straight lines (whether at a finite,
or at an infinite prolongation of them) at length run
together into one and the same straight line, than that
one and the same straight line (whether at a finite, or at
an infinite prolongation of it) splits into two straight
lineS‚ against the preceding Lemma II, and its corollary.

Since therefore it is in like manner opposed to the
nature of the straight line (from the preceding corollary
to the last lemma), that two straight lines at one and the
same point of a third straight, be perpendicular to this
in the same common plane; it is proper to recognize as
absolutely false, because repugnant to the aforesaid na-
ture, the hypothesis of acute angle, according to which
