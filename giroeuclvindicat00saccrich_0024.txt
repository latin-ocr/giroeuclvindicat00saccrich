Says Heath: “Mill's account of the true distinction be-
tween real and nominal definitions had been fully antici-
pated by Saccheri.''

In his Loyica demonstrativa Saecheri lays down the
clear distinction between what he calls definitiones quid
nominis or nominaleS, and definitiones quid rei or realeS,
namely, that the former are only intended to explain the
meaning that is to be attached to a given term, whereas the
latter, besides declaring the meaning of a word, affirm at
the same time the existence of the thing defined or, in
geometry, the possibility of constructing it. The definitio
quid nominis becomes a definitio quid rei “by means of a
postulate, or when we come to the question whether the
thing exists and it is answered affirmatively.”2

Definitiones quid nominis are in themselves quite arbi-
trary‚ and neither require nor are capable of proof ; they
are merely provisional‚ and are only intended to be turned
as quickly as possible into definitiones quid rei, either

1. by means of a postulate in which it is asserted or
conceded that what is defined exists or can be constructed,
e. g.‚ in the case of straiyht lines and circleS, to which
Euclid's first three postulates refer, or

2. by means of a demonstration reducing the construc-
tion οἱ the figure defined to the successive carrying-out of
a certain number of those elementary constructions5 the
possibility of which is postulated. Thus definitiones quid rei
are in general obtained as the result of a series of demon-
strations.

Saccheri gives as an instance the construction of a square
in Euclid Ι. 46.

Suppose that it is ob-jected that Euclid had no right to
define a square, as he does at the beginning of the Book,
when it was not certain that such a figure exists; the ob—
jection‚ he sayS‚ could only have force if, before proving
and making the construction, Euclid had assumed the afore-

postulatum vel dum venitur ad quaestionem an est et respondetur
affirmative.'' Ibid.
