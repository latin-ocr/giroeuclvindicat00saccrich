PROPOSITION XXXIV,

I n which is investiyated a certain curve arisiny from the
hypothesis of acute angle}

Let the straight CD j oin equal perpendiculars AC, BD
standing upon a certain straight AB. Then AB, CD being

bisected in the points M and H (fig. 42), MH is joined
perpendicular (by P. II.) to each.

Again in this hypothesis the an- Argu*

gles at the join CD are supposed <²
acute. Therefore in the quadri-
lateral AMHC (by Cor. Ι. to P.
ΙΙΙ.) ΜΗ will be less than AC.
Hence now, if in MH produced A

ΜΚ be taken equal to AC, the Fig ΜΩ.

curve here investigated. Then the angles at the join
CK will be themselves acute (by P. VII.).

Therefore the join LX, which bisectS, and therefore
(by P. IL), is at right angles to AM, CK, will be like-
wise (by Cor. I. to P. III.) less than AC. Wherefore, if
in LX produced we assume LF equal to AC or MK, the
point F also will pertain to this curve. Further, joining
CF, and FK we find likewise two other points pertaining
to the same curve And so on forever
