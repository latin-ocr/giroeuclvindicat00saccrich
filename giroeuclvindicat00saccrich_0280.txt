PAGE 33. Prop. VI: Here is assumed the principle of
continuity. An elementary proof without this and without
the Archimedes assumption is given by Bonola. ’

Without these, and with only a sect-carrier replacing the
circle in constructionS, Euclid’s geometry and a geometry
fulfilling the hypothesis of obtuse angle are given in Halsted,
Ge'ombtrie rationnelle, PariS, Gauthier-Villars. Compare, for
the hypothesis of acute angle: John Bolyai, The Science
Absolute of Space‚ translated from the Latin by Dr. George
Bruce Halsted; and Nicholas Lobachevski‚ Geometrical Re-
searches on the Theory of Parallels, translated from the
original by George Bruce Halsted (The Open Court Pub-
lishing Company, 1914).

PAGE 95f. Demonstrations physico-geometriC. If in a
single case the angle inscribed in a semicircle be ascertained
to be right, Euclidean geometry is established. But measure-
ment being imperfect, this is hopeless. What if such angle
were found other than right by a difference greater than the
limits of experimental error?

Science, New York, The Science Press, 1913.

PAGE 109. Prop. XXI. Scholion IV: Saccheri misses
the possibility that the intersection point P of APY and
XPY may go to infinity while AX remains finite.

PAGE 192. Ly is a term of the grammarians and rhetori-
cianS, by which is denoted the treatment of a word as itself
a thing. The Greek article τὸ was thus used.

PAGE 221. Prop. XXXVII. Scholion I: Is it possible
Saccheri did not perceive that his reasoning applies just as
well to proving two concentric circles equal?

PAGE 224. Prop. XXXVII. Scholion II: “aequali tem—
pore‚” yes3 but “aequali motu’' is unproven.
