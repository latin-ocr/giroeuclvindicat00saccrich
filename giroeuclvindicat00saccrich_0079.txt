since with this (Eu. I. 13) [12] the angle XAH makes

up two. Wheret'ore, subtracting the right angle HAB,
the angles ADB and BAD will be together less than one

right angle.
Quod erat tertium.

PROPOSITION X.

I f the straight ΠΒ (fiy. 8) stand perpendicular to a
straight ΑΒΜ, and the join DM be yreater than the
join DA, then also the base ΒΜ will be greater than
the base ΒΑ. And inversely.

PROOF. And in the first place assuredly these bases
will not be mutually equal. Otherwise (Eu. Ι. 4) AD
and DM would be equal, contrary to the hypothesis..

, But neither will BA be greater than ΒΜ. Otherwise.
in BA the portion ΒΞ being taken equal to ΒΜ, and SD
joined, the angles BSD, BMD (Eu. Ι. 4) would be equal.
But angle BSD is (Eu. Ι. 16) greater than angle BAD.
Therefore angle BMD would be greater than angle BAD.
But this is contrary to Eu. Ι. 18; since side DM in triangle

MDA is supposed greater than side DA. It remains .

therefore, that the base ΒΜ is greater than the base BA.

Quod erat primo loco demonstrandum.

Next if either base, as ΒΑ suppose (the figure need
not be changed) is conceived as greater than the other
ΒΜ ; then the join DS, which cuts off from ΒΑ the por·-
tion ΞΒ equal to ΒΜ, will be equal (Eu. Ι. 4) to the

⁸ join DM. Again angle DSA will be obtuse (Eu. Ι. 16)
and angle DAS acute (Eu. Ι. 17).
