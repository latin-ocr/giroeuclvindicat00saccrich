PROPOSITION XIII.

I f the straiyht ΧΑ (of desiynated lenyth however yreat)
meetiny two straiyhts AD, XL, makes with them
toward the same parts (ᾖς. 11) interna! anyles XAD,
AXL less than two riyht anyles: I say, these two
(even if neither of those anyles be a riyht anyle)
at lenyth will mutually meet in some point on the
side toward those anyles, and indeed at a finite, or

terminated distance, if either hypothesis holds, of
riyht anyle or of obtuse anqle.

PROOF. For one of the said angleS, as AXL suppose,
will be acute.

Accordingly from the vertex of the other angle is
dropped the perpendicular ΑΡ on XL, which certainly

(because of Eu. I. 17) falls on the side of the acute angle
AXL. Since therefore in the triangle APX, right-angled
at P, the two acute angles PAX, PXA, together are not
less (P. IX.) than a right angle, in either hypothesiS, of
right angle, or of obtuse angle; if these two angles are
taken away from the sum οἱ the given angles the then
remaining angle PAD will be less than a right angle.
Consequently we will be in the case of the two preceding
proposition5‚ since it is obvious that one or the other
hypothesis holds, either of right angle, or of obtuse angle.

Wherefore the straights AD, and PL, or XL, meet

in some point at a finite, or terminated distance on the

side noted, [17] as well under the one as under the other
mentioned hypothesis

Quod erat demonstrandum.
