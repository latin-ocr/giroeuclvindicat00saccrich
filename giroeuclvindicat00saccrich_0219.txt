from the point A through X toward B) cannot have two
different positions in the same plane, in both of which
the portion indeed AX persists in the same place, but the
other portion XB in one of those two positions fits (for
example) XC, and in the other position fits- XM.

Of course I do not here deny, that the portion XB, if
it is supposed to be moved in its plane about the point X,
so that successively it fits exactly (from the preceding
lemma) not merely XM, XC, but also exactly fits [75]
the other infinitely many straightS, which from the point
X may be drawn to the remaining intermediate points of
the arc BC: I say, Ι do not here deny, that XB in any of
its positions may be considered as the continuation in a
straight of that fixed AX; when rather I have demon-
strated already about AXM that this would happen in

, case of the hypothesis of a common segment: Solely

therefore I here affirm, in one merely of those new posi-
tionS, as suppose while it fits XC, may be retained by it
the same arbitrary continuation, which it has in the first
position, where from the point A it goes out through X
toward the point Β.

And this indeed is demonstrated thus. For first it is
evident that the continuation AXB cannot be wholly
similar, or equal to the continuation AXC, if each is
considered toward the same part whether left or right3
because otherwise in such position AXB, AXC must
mutually coincide; which is against the hypothesis of that
common segment AX: I say, must coincide; provided
that of course, in relation to the same fixed AX, the con-
tinuations XB, and XC in the plane concerned extend
just similarly toward the same part whether left or right.

Secondly is evident that nothing prevents the aforesaid
continuation AXB, considered toward one part, as suppose,
toward the left, being precisely similar, or equal to the
continuation AXC, considered toward the opposite part,
