dicular ΒΚ, or ΒΧ, and therefore may be considered in
turn as perpendiculars that AB, and the equal opposite

sect KL, or XR.
Therefore is established that if even in a single case

the hypothesis of right angle be true, always in every
case it alone is true.
Quod erat demonstrandum.

PROPOSITION VI.

If even in a sinyle case the hypothesis of obtuse anyle
is true, always in every case it alone is true.

PROOF. Let the join CD (fig. 5) make obtuse angles
with any two equal perpendiculars AC,

BD, standing upon any straight AB. Β χ
CD will be (P. ΙΙΙ.) less than this 8-1·

A .
BAssume in AC and BD produced -D

any two mutually equal portions CR 1⁴-¹5
[8] and DX ; and join RX. —

Now I investigate the angles at the Α b
join RX, which certainly (P. I.) will Fig. ⁵·
be mutually equal.

If they are obtuse we have our assertion.

But they are not right; because thus we would have
a case for the hypothesis of right angle, which (P. V.)
would leave no place for the hypothesis of obtuse angle.
But neither are they acute.

For thus RX would be (P. III.) greater than this
AB; and still more therefore greater than CD itself. But
that this cannot be is thus shown. If the quadrilateral
CDXR is taken to be filled up by straights cutting off
from these CR, DX, portions mutually equal, this implies

transition from the sect CD, which is less than AB itse1f‚
to RX greater than it, verily transition through a certain
