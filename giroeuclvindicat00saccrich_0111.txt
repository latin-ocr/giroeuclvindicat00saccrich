you choose can be designated,[26l under which if any
straight line meets another, this produced must (at a
finite or terminated distance) finally meet any perpen-
dicular erected upon this incident straight at whatever

finite distance.

PROPOSITION XVIII.

From any trianyle ABC, of which (fiy. 17) the anyle at
the point Β is inscribed in any semicircle of diameter
AC, is established the hypothesis of riyht anyle, or
obtuse anyle, or acute angle, accordiny as indeed the
anyle at the point Β is riyht, or obtuse, or acute.

PROOF. From the center D join DB. The angles at
the base AB will be (Eu. I. 5) equal, and likewise at
the base BC, in the triangles ADB,

CDB. Wherefore, in the triangle V Β
ABC the two angles at the base Δ
AC will be together equal to the A

whole angle ABC. Therefore the ‘D

three angles of the triangle ABC F¹g' ¹7·

will be together equal to, or greater, or less than two
right angleS, according as the angle at the point B is right,
or obtuse, or acute.

Therefore from any triangle ABC, of which the angle
at the point B is inscribed in any semicircle of diameter
AC, is established (P. XV.) the hypothesis of right angle,
or obtuse angle, or acute angle, according as indeed the
angle at the point B is right, or obtuse, or acute.

Quod erat demonstrandum.

PROPOSITION XIX.

Let there be any trianyle AHD (fiy. 18) riyht-anyled at
H. Then in AD produced the portion DC is as-
sumed equal to this AD,· and the perpendicular C Β
