this DB produced outwardly. Therefore AM and CM
being joined, the angle AMC will be acute, because less
(Eu. Ι. 21) than the angle ABG, which is assumed right.

Therefore (from the preceding proposition) is estab-
lished the hypothesis of acute angle.

Quod erat tertio loco demonstrandum.

Itaque constant omnia proposita. [28]

PROPOSITION XX.

Let there be a trianyle ΛΟΜ (fiy. 19) riyht-cmyled at C.
Then from the point Β bisectiny this AM let fall the
perpendicular BD to AC. I say this perpendicular
will not be (in the hypothesis of acute angle) greater
than half the perpendicular MC.

PROOF. For let DB be produced to DH double DB.
Therefore DH would be (if DB be
greater than the aforesaid half)
greater than CM, and therefore
equal to a certain continuation

CMK.

Join AH, HK, HM, MD. Now
we proceed thuS. Since in the tri-
angles HBA, DBM, the sides HE,
BA are assumed equal to the sides

 

DB, BM; and (Eu. Ι. 15) the Ρ
angles at the point B are equa13
the base HA also (Eu. Ι. 4) will be equal to the base

MD. Then, by the same reasoning‚ in the triangles

HBM, DBA, the bases HM, DA will be equal. Where-
fore in the triangles MHA‚ ADM, the angles MHA,
ADM (Eu. Ι. 8) will be equal.

Again in the triangles AHB, MDB, the residual angle
MHB will remain equal to the residual right angle ADB.
Therefore the angle MHB will be right. But this is ab·
