said figure as given. That Euclid is not guilty of this error
is clear from the fact that he never presupposes the existence
of the square as defined until after Ι. 46.

Confusion between the nominal and the real definition
as thus described, i. e., the use of the former in demon-
stration before it has been turned into the latter by the
necessary proof that the thing defined exists, is, according
to Saccheri, one of the most fruitful sources of illusory
demonstration, and the danger is greater in proportion to
the “complexity'' of the definition, i. e., the number of vari-
ety of the attributes belonging to the thing defined. For
the greater is the possibility that there may be among the
attributes some that are incompatible, i. e., the simultaneous
presence of which in a given figure can be proved, by means
of other postulates, etc., forming part of the basis of the
science, to be impossible.

This signal anticipation of Mill’s famous distinction
would alone justify the only known protagonist of the
Loyica demonstrativa hitherto, Vailati‚ in saying of Sac-
cheri: “This gives him the right to an eminent place in the
history of modern logic.''

But in additional elaboration Saccheri broadens the mat-
ter, clearly recognizing the more general question relative
to the necessity of excluding the possible existence of in-
compatibility among the fundamental postulates made the
basis of a demonstrative science3 and not merely their
directly contradicting one another, but whether the falsity
of one of them could be proved by means of the otherS‚
a thing not directly recognizable.

These questions, far from having grown old, are ac-
quiring an ever greater importance with the accentuation
of the modern tendency to regard as the function of mathe-
matics, the development, logically coherent, of the conse-
quences flowing from a given system of premises‚ whether
or no these be susceptible of a direct interpretation or ex-
perimental verification.

Since actually, in this case, the postulates assume the
character of simple hypotheses subject only to the condition
