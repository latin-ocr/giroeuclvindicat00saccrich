indeed the angle KLK to the angle KMK, and the angle
LKK to the angle MKK„ Therefore equal also are the
remainders NKM and HKL. Wherefore, since the sides
NK, KM of the triangle NKM are equal in the same way
to the sides HK, KL of the triangle HKL, equal also
will be (from the same Eu. Ι. 4) the bases ΝΜ, HL,
the angles KNM, KHL,' and finally the angles KMN,
KLH. But in the preceding triangles are already proved
equal the angles KLK‚ KMK, Therefore the whole angle
NMK is equal to the whole angle HLK.

Wherefore‚ since all angles at the points K are right,
it follows manifestly all four angles together of the
quadrilateral KNMK are equal to all four angles together
of the quadrilateral KHLK.

But since the two angles together at the points N and
M in the quadrilateral KNMK are greater, in hypothesis
of acute angle, than the two angles together (from Cor.
after P. XVI.) at the points D and H in the quadrilateral
NDHM, or the quadrilateral KDHK‚ the consequence
thence is, that (the common right angles at the points Κ
being added) the four angles together of the quadrilatera]
KNMK, or the quadrilateral KHLK are greater (in

hypothesis of acute angle) than the four angles together
of the quadrilateral KDHK.

Quod erat demonstrandum. [50]

COROLLARY.

But it ought here opportunely to be observed, nothing
will fail in the argument made, although the angle at the
point L is assumed right, together with hypothesis of
acute angle. For still that common perpendicular LK
would be less (from Cor. I. to P. III.) than the other
perpendicular HK, from which therefore still a portion
MK could be assumed equal to the aforesaid LK.
