by Saccheri under the name of fallaciae duplicis hypothesis
are precisely those which consist in believing that conse-
quences worth considering can be deduced from systems of
hypotheses incompatible with one another (to wit, such
that among them are some whose negation can be deduced
from the others) ; and of such he passes in review various
typeS‚ beginning with the simplest, namely, that of a syllo-
gism whose premises directly contradict one another, and
going on to the more complicated cases in which the contra—
diction can be revealed only by the successive development
of the consequences os the system of hypotheseS, or postu-
lates, assumed as basis of the entire matter.

In the investigation of the independence of postulates the
method consists in finding a case or a particular interpre-
tation in which the proposition we wish to prove not dedu-
cible from others given, ceases to be true while all the others
remain true. If such is found, we conclude that the propo-
sition cannot be deduced from these otherS, else it would be
true whenever they were.

This use and construction of examples to show the
independence of a certain proposition from others given
has of late assumed the importance of an ordinary and
indispensable procedure in the strictly rigorous elaboration
of any deductive theory (in America, Robert L. Moore,
Huntington, Veblen, and others). But Saccheri was the
first to use this procedure, and constructs his example with-
out leaving the field of formal logie. If his treatment of
his “hypothesis of acute angle'' is another case, it is the most
marvelous in the world. ν

In his Opus de proportionibus (lib. V, prop. 201),8
Cardan (born at Pavia, 1501), to prove that two sides of
a certain triangle he has occasion to consider are greater
than a certain arc of a circle comprised between them, adopts
a peculiar reasoning and vaunts himself of this singular
procedure as an extraordinary discovery of his own:
