ever, if indeed the waves of oblivion have not already closed
over it.

Manganotti planned a reproduction of the Euclides
vindicatus-3 Alberto Pascal planned a complete Italian ver-
sion, saying, “We cannot call an Italian translation that pub-
lished by G. Boccardini‚ which with its curious abbreviated
demonstrationS, with its suppression οἱ whole pages and
with its prudent transcription entire ot' Latin passages not
easily translatable, truly knows not itself what it is.'’

Death vetoed these plans.

Meanwhile legends grow up and persist about Saccheri
himself. For example, no less an authority than a president
of the New York Mathematical Society, misled by scraps
of Saccheri's Latin given by Beltrami, has in an article “On
the Early History of Non-Euclidean Geometry'’ (Bull. N.
Y. Math. Soc„ Vol. II, pp. 144-147) the sentence: “He con-
fessed to a distracting heretical tendency on his part in favor
of the hypothesis anyuh' acuti, a tendency against which,
however, he kept up a perpetual struggle (diuturnum proe-
lium).'’ And this sentence is quoted without dissent in
The M onist, Vol. IV, p. 489. Contrast the truth of the
matter by glancing at Saccheri’s “Indicis loco'' given below,
where the two quoted words occur (last sentence on p. xii).

But inaccessible as he waS‚ and legendary as he became,
Saccheri's immortality was already assured. The name of
his friend Ceva is carried by Ceva's Theorem.

Coolidge in his Non-Euclidean Geometry names Sac-
cheri's thetheorem: “In an isosceles birectangular quadri-
lateral a line through the middle point of the side adjacent
to both right angleS, which is perpendicular to the line of
that side, will be perpendicular to the line of the opposite
side and pass through its middle point. The other two
angles of the quadrilateral are mutually congruent.'' In
1905 Bonola calls Saccheri's the theorem: “If the angle-sum
in one triangle be equal to, greater than, or less than two
right angleS, so will it be in every triangle.'' But in 1896
Mansion had admirably chosen as Thborbme de Saccheri:
“Dans l'hypothese οὺ la somme des angles d'un triangle est
