the line DC generated by this motion can only be adjudged
a straight line.

But in so far as may be here permissible to cite phys-
ical experimentation‚ I forthwith bring forward three
demonstrations physico—geometric to sanction the Euclid-
ean postulate.

Therewith I do not speak of physical experimentation
extending into the infinite, and therefore impossible for
us ; such as of course would be requisite to the cognizing‚
that all points of the straight join DC are equidistant
from the straight AB, which is supposed to be in the same
plane with this DC.

For a single individual case will be sufficient for me;
as suppose, if, the straight DC being joined, and any one
point of it N being assumed, the perpendicular NM let
fall to the underlying AB is ascertained to be equal to
BD or AC. For then the angles on both sides at the
point N would be equal (P. I.) to the angles correspond-
ing to them at the points C and D, which again (from
the same P. Ι.) would be equal inter se. Wherefore the
angles on both sides at the point N, and therefore also
the remaining two will be right.

Therefore we shall have a case for the hypothesis of
right angle; and consequently (by Propp. V. and XIII.)
we shall have demonstrated the Euclidean postulate. And
this may be the first demonstration physico-geometric.

I pass over to the second. Let there be a semi-circle,
of which the center is D, and diameter AC. If then
(fig. 17) any point B is assumed in its circumference, to
which AB, CB joined are ascertained to contain a right
angle, this single case will be sufficient (as I have demon-
strated in P. XVIII.) for establishing the hypothesis of
right angle, and consequently ( from the aforesaid P.
XIII.) for demonstrating that famous postulate. [36]

There remains the third demonstration physico-geo-
