IN PLACE OF AN INDEX

SHOULD BE ADDED, I THINK, WHAT FOLLOWS. Α

1. In Propp. I. and II. of the First Book
two principles are established, from which in
Propp. III. and IV. is proved, that interior an-
gles at the straight joining the extremities of
equal perpendiculars erected toward the same
parts (in the same plane) from two points of
another straight, as base, not merely are equal
to each other, but besides are either right or
obtuse or acute according as that join is equal
to, or leSS, or greater than the aforesaid base:
and inversely. From page 1 on.

2. Hence occasion is taken to distinguish
three different hypotheseS, one of right angle,
another of obtuse, a third of acute: about which
in Propp. V„ VI„ and VII. is proved, that any
one of these hypotheses is always alone true if
it is found true in any one particular case. From paye 5 on.

3. Then after the interposition of three other
necessary propositionS, is proved in Propp. XI.,
XII., and XIII.‚ the universal truth of the fa-
mous axiom, respect being had to the first two
hypotheseS‚ one of right angle, and the other
of obtuse; and at length in P. XIV. is shown
the absolute falsity of the hypothesis of obtuse
