parture, none the less do we likewise arrive at the con—
clusion that the proposition in question is true.

In this process we reach nothing absurd or false, but
thus proceeding we attain the very proposition which was
to be proved, so that in this way it shows itself as a con-
sequence of its own negation.⁷

In his preface‚ Saccheri‚ enumerating the parts of his
work in which he believes himself to have made new and
important contributions to the ordinary treatment of logie,
gives first place to Chapter 11 of Part Ι, devoted precisely
to this type of reasoning. He might still claim the merit
of being not only the first but the only one to employ this
method in a systematic treatise on logic. To have applied
it to the elaboration of the rules of the scholastic logie,
Saccheri regards as one of the most important amelioratio-ns
introduced by him in the treatment of the subject, and for
us it is highly significant to note how the greatest advantage
inherent in this innovation of his consists for him in his
being able by this means to render his exposition indepen-
dent of the assumption of a certain postulate he believes
indispensable if the ordinary treatment be followed.

Hence there is an exact correspondence between the
use he makes in his Loyica of this demonstrative procedure,
and the use he afterward attempted to make of it in his
Euclides vindicatus, aiming to obviate the necessity of as-
suming the Parallel Postulate.

Vailati‚ of whose few precious pages we avail ourselves‚
points out that Saccheri tells how already in his youth he
arrived at the idea that the characteristic property of the
most fundamental propositions, in every demonstrative sci-
ence, was precisely their being indemonstrable except by
recourse to this IX—-IZ type of argumentation (see Eu.
vind„ pp. 99-100)‚ and then adds:

“It was in hopes of reaching in this way a proof of the
Parallel Postulate, namely, deducing it from the very hy—
pothesis of its falsity, that Saccheri pushed on in the in-

eoque, ostensive ac directe, propositum eliciam.’' Log. dem„ p. 130.
