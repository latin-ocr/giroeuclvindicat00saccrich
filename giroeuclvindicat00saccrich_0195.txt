(from the preceding proposstion) without any certain
limit, to equality with a right angle, when indeed that
AC ls supposed to meet ΒΧ only at an z χ χ
infinite distance.

Therefore such an ordinate KMD
can be reached that at it the angle
AMK exceeds a right angle by less
than the angle DAC. But then angle
DAC, or DAM, together with angle
AMD will be greater than a right angle.

Wheret'ore the obtuse angle ADM Α
being added, the three angles together
of the triangle ADM will be greater than two right
angleS‚ which is against the hypothesis of acute angle.

Theret‘ore every straight AC, which cuts that angle
BAX, finally at a finite or terminated distance (even in
the hypothesis of acute angle) must meet ΒΧ in a certain

point P.

Hence no straight AZ, which toward the parts of the
points X makes an acute angle greater than BAX can
ever meet ΒΧ, either at a finite or at an infinite distance.

For as far as so should happen, now AX, dividing
angle BAZ‚ ought (against the premised supposition)
to meet ΒΧ at a finite distance, as this is demonstrated
of the straight AC dividing angle BAX,

COROLLARY ΙΙ.

Moreover it follows that no determinate acute angle
will be the maximum of all under which a straight line
produced from point A meets ΒΧ at finite distance.

For if toward the parts ot‘ the point X you assume
any point higher than point P, it follows that the straight
