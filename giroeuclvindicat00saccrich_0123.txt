were at another time demonstrated, that the distance of
the two AH, AD produced in infinitum goes out ever
greater beyond all finite assignable limit.

But that the aforesaid Clavius should have judged
the truth of this assumption sufficient for demonstrating
the postulate here in question; that ought to be blamed
to the opinion preconceived by Clavius about equidistant
straight lineS, which we may discuss more conveniently
in a subsequent scholion.

SCHOLION ΙΙ.

In which is weiyhed an idea of that brilliant man Giovanni
Alfonso Borelli in his Euclides RestitutuS.

This most learned author blames Euclid, because he
defines parallel straight lines to be those, which being]
in the same plane do not meet on either side, even if
produced in infinitum.

He offers as ground for his accusation, that such
relation [32] is unknown: first, he sayS‚ because we are
iquorant, whether such infinite non-concurrent lines can
be found in nature: then also because we cannot perceive
the properties of the infinite, aud hence a relation of this
sort is not clearly coynized.

But with reverence for so great a man it may be said.-
Can Euclid be blamed, because (to bring forward one
among innumerable examples) he defines α square to be a
fiyure quadrilateral, equilateral, rectanyular; when it may
be doubted, whether a figure of this sort has place in
nature? He could, say I, most justly have been blamed,
if, before as a problem demonstrating the construction, he
had assumed the aforesaid figure as given.

But that Euclid is free from this fault follows mani-
festly from this, that he nowhere assumes the square de·
fined by him, except after Prop. 46 of the First Book,
