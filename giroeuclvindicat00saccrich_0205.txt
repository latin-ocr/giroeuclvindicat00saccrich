KMLK, [68] the four angles together should be equal to
or greater than four rights, contrary to the hypothesis
of acute angle, according to which we are proceeding.
Therefore all such angles will be acute toward the parts
of the point L ; and therefore in like manner all at these
points obtuse toward the parts of the point A. Where-
fore (from Cor. I to P. ΙΙΙ.) of the aforesaid perpen-
>diculars the least will indeed be KL more remote from
the base AB, the greatest KM nearer this base.

And of the remaining the nearer will be ever greater
than the more remote. .

Therefore ( from the preceding P. XXV, and its corol-
lary) the four angles together of the quadrilateral KHLK
more remote from base AB will be greater than the four
angles together of all the remaining quadrilaterals nearer
to this base. Wherefore (as in P. XXV.) the hypothesis
of acute angle would be destroyed.

Therefore it holds, that of the aforesaid common per-
pendiculars in two distinct points there will be no deter-
minate limit, such that under a smaller and smaller
acute angle made at the point A, it would not always be
possible to attain (in the hypothesis of acute angle) to such
a common perpendicular in two distinct points as may be
less than any assigned length R.

Quod erat demonstrandum.

PROPOSITION XXXII.

Now I say there is (in the hypothesis of acute anate) a
certain determinate acute anyle ΒΑΧ drawn under
which AX (fiy. 33) only at an infinite distance meets
EX, and thus is a limit in part from zvithin, ih part
from without‚· on the one hand of all those which
under lesser acute anyles meet the aforesaid ΒΧ at
a finite distance 3 on the other hand also of the others
