lemma) the direct prolongation of any assumed simple
straight AX cannot be understood to be other than the
one XD, which proceeds ex aequo on both sides in rela-
tion to the left, and right side of the aforesaid AX;
from which assuredly follows, that with AX fixed it can-
not, itselt‘ unchanged, have another position in this plane.

But that in the same plane a certain other XM can
be designated to the left, splitting infinitely little from
XD, nothing avaiIS. For again another, XF, likewise to
the right could be designated, which just so splits in-
finitely little from the same'XD. Wheret‘ore (as in the
the lemma before cited) [82] alone AXD will be the
straight line defined by us

The third finally is: in this second lemma may be
judged immediately demonstrated Eu. XI. 1 ; that of the
same straight one part cannot be in a lower plane, and
another in an upper.

LEMMA III.

If two straiyhts ΑΒ, CXD meet each other (fiy. 39) in
any intermediate point X of their-5, they do not there
touch each other, but one σαῖς the other there.

PROOF. For if that were possible, the whole CXD
lies on one and the same side of AB. Join AC. Then
AC will not be the same with AXC

as if prolonged; because otherwise Λ

(against the preceding lemma) of Γ ’ V Β
two straightS, one AXC. and the 'Q
other the assumed DXC, there

would be one and the same com-
mon segment XC.

And so join BC. Again this BC will not be a pro-
longation of BA to the point C; lest two straightS, one

XAC, portion of this ΒΑΕ, and the other XC inclose a
space, against the preceding Lemma Ι.
