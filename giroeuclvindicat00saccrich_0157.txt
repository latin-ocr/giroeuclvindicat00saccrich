Ι see indeed it may here be asked in what way that
common perpendicular can be shown, when any straight
PF HD (fig. 28) meeting two AX, ΒΧ in points F, and
H, makes toward the same parts two internal angles
AHF, BF H, not themselves indeed right, but neverthe-
less [47] together equal to two rights, But behold that
common perpendicular geometrically demonstrated.

 

Fig. 28.

F H being bisected in M, perpendiculars MK, ML
are let fall to AX and ΒΧ. The angle MFL will be equal
(Eu. Ι. 13) to the angle MHK, which indeed is assumed
to make up two right angles with the angle BFH, More-
over the angles at the points K, and L are right; and again
MF, MH are equal. Therefore (Eu. Ι. 26) so are the
angles FML‚ HMK equal. Wherefore the angle HMK
makes two right angles with the angle HML, since with
this the angle FML (Eu. I. 13) makes two right angles,
Therefore (Eu. Ι. 14) KML will be in one continuous

straight line, consequently a common perpendicular to
the aforesaid straights AX, ΒΧ.

But again Ι am able hence to show that those two
straights AX, ΒΧ, meeting with which the straight PF HD
makes with the said AX, ΒΧ either two internal angles
toward the same parts equal to two right angleS, or
