TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.

Saccheri was discovered accidentally by Father Man-
ganotti, S. J.‚ in 1889, a discovery which could not have

erudite and accurate Sir Thomas Heath, in his three-volumed
masterpiece, has listed Saccheri's Euclides vindicatus as a
Latin edition of Euclid, calling Saccheri its editor, a mis-

who had been privileged to see Saccheri's diadem.

help to avert from it the imminent peril of perishing for—
