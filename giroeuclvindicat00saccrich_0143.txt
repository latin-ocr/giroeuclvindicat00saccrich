say wholly similar; because I do not need the propor-
tionality of the sides about the equal angleS, nay nor any
determinate measure of the sides

So let the angles at the points Fig. 24.

A, Β, C, be equal to the angles

at the points D, E, F; and let the side DE be less than
the side AB3 and in AB is assumed the portion AG equal
to this DE, and likewise in AC the portion AH equal to
this DF. But that DF must be less than AC Ι will make
clear below. Then (GH joined) follows (from Eu. I. 4)
the angles at the points E, and F will be equal [41] to AGH‚
AHG. However since the just mentioned angleS, together

with the others BGH‚ CHG, are equal (Eu. I. 13) to four
right angles; likewise will be equa] to four right angles

, the angles at the points B, and C, together with these same

angles BGH‚ CHG, Therefore the four angles of the
quadrilateral BGHC will be together equal to four right
angles; and consequently (from P. XVI.) is established
the hypothesis of right angle; and at the same time (from
P. XIII.) the Euclidean postulate.

Moreover I have supposed the side DF, or AH assumed
equal to it, to be less than the'side AC. For if it were
equal‚ and so the point H should fall upon the point C,
then the angle BCA would be equal (by hypothesis) to
the angle EFD, or GCA (which then it would become)
a part to the whole; which is absurd.

But if it were greater, and so the join GH should cut
BC itself in some point, now the external angle ACB
would be from the hypothesis equal (against Eu. I. 16) to
