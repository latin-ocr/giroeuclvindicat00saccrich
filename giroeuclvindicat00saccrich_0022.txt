Augustae Taurinorum Typis Joannis Baptistae Zappatae
1697. Superiorum permissu.

(In 16⁰, pp. xii-287.)

Thus, in this first edition, the name of the author does
not appear. Taking advantage of the examination of Count
Gravere, then his student, Saccheri‚ with the theseS, pub-
lished his course in logie, letting it appear as if the count’s.

The only existing copy is in the Biblioteca Nazionale
of Milan (Colloc. B. X. 4854).

On it is written:

Auctore P’re. H yeronymo Saccherio societatis Iesu,
and below:

Ex Biblioth’a C olleyii Brayd’is Soc’fs Iesu. Ins.[criptus]
Catal’0.

Saccheri, astute and prudent, had his reasons for issuing
this three-year child of his genius under the count’s cloak.
Then as professor he changed subjects and residence, and
only four years afterward did the book appear with* his
name.

The first issue Saccheri never mentions, The second
edition, so called, he refers to repeatedly and insistently.
It differs from the first by some suppressionS‚ especially in
the preface, but no thought has been added during these
four years of waiting.

Its title is:
