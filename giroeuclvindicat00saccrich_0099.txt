all the angles of the triangles ADB, CDB will be together

equal to four right angleS, because of the two additional
’ right angles at the point D. This holding good, now of
neither of the said triangleS, as suppose ADB, will the
three angles together be leSS‚ or greater than two> right
angles; for thus vice versa the three angles together of
the other triangle would be greater, or less than two right
angles, Wherefore (P. IX.) from one triangle would
indeed be established the hypothesis of acute angle, and
from the other the hypothesis of obtuse angle; [21] which
is contrary to P. VI. and P. VII.

Therefore the three angles together of either of the
aforesaid triangles will be equal to two right angles ; and
thereby (P. IX.) is established the hypothesis of right
angle.

Quod erat primo loco demonstrandum.

But if however the three angles of the proposed tri-
angle ΑΒΕ are taken greater than two right angles: now
of the two triangles ADB, CDB all the angles together
will be greater than four right angleS, because of the two
additional right angles at the point D.

This holding good: now of neither of the said tri-
angles will the three angles together be precisely equal
to, or less than two right angles: for thus vice versa
the three angles of the other triangle would be together
greater than two right angleS. Wherefore (P. IX.)
from one triangle indeed would be established the hypoth-
esis either of right angle or of acute angle, and from the
other the hypothesis of obtuse angle, which is contrary
to Propp. V„ VI„ and VII.

Therefore the three angles together of either of the
aforesaid triangles will be greater than two right angles;
and therefore is established the hypothesis of obtuse
angle.

Quod erat secundo loco demonstrandum.
