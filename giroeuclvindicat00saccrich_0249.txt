So NF produced must fall wholly toward the convex
partS‚ and so it will be tangent to this curve.

PROPOSITION XXXVI.

I s any straiyht XF (fiy. 44) makes an acute angle with
any ordinate LF, the point X does not fall without
the cavity of the curve, unless previously XF has
cut the curve in some point O.

PROOF. It is sure that some point X may be assumed
in XF so near to the point F, that the join LX previously
cuts the curve in some point S:
otherwise XF either does not fall
wholly without the cavity of the ο Α

curve, and so we have our asser-
tion; or so far is it from mak-
ing with FL an acute angle, that
now rather it must be supposed Α , b

to combine with LF in one
straight.

Accordingly from the point S let fall to the base AB
the perpendicular ΞΡ. This will be (from P. XXXIV )
equal to LF.

But ΞΡ 1s (from Eu Ι. 19) less than LS. Therefore
also LF' is less than LS, and consequently much less than
LX. Hence in triangle LXF the angle at point X will
be acute, because less (from Eu. I. 18) than the angle
LFX supposed acute.

Now let fall to FX the perpendicular LT. This will fall
(because of Eu. I. 17) toward the parts of each acute
angle. Wherefore point T will lie between points X,
and F.

Then from the point T let fall to the base AB the
perpendicular TQ. LF will be (because of the right
