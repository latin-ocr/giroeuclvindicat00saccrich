would be in this way common. But this is evidently
repugnant to the nature of the straight line.

But if to any one may seem less opportune the obtuse
angle at the point X toward the parts of the point A, it
may easily be supposed right; so that indeed (in the
motion of the aforesaid XY at angles always right above
the straight ΑΖ) more manifestly may appear that the
single points of that XY are always moved uniformly
relatively to the basal AZ; and therefore the aforesaid
XY cannot go over from a secant into a non-secant of the
other indefinite AY, unless either once in some point it
precisely touches it, or meets it in some point P, where
it has with this AY a common segment PY; each of
which I shall show contrary to the nature of the straight
line in P. XXXIII.

Therefore in accordance with the true idea of the
straight line, must that XY, however great the distance
of the point X from the point A, always meet in some
point this AY. And that this indeed (however small is
supposed the acute angle at the point A) is sufficient for

demonstrating‚ against the hypothesis of acute angle, the
Euclidean postulate, will follow from P. XXVII.
