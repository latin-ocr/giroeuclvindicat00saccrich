late as conceded to him, but demonstrates through a
problem in his Bk. I. P. ll. For there he teaches from any
given point A (fig. 40) in the straight BC to erect a
perpendicular AD at which the angles DAB, DAC are
equal to each other.

Moreover that those two angles are precisely equal
to each other, without any difference even infinitely small.
follows from the corollary after the first two premised
lemmata, [85] if AB, AC are taken exactly equal.

B Α 0 Ρ n Μ

But some doubt may arise, if two other right angles
LHF, LHM (fig. 41) at any other straight FM are
compared with the aforesaid right angles DAB, DAC.

Therefore let HL be equal to AD, and then the whole
latter figure is thought to be superposed upon the former
SO, that point H falls upon point A, and point L upon
point D.

Now I proceed thus,

And first indeed (from a preceding lemma [III]) this
FHM does not exactly touch the other BC in the point
A. Therefore either it runs forward precisely upon BC,
or will cut it so that one of its end points for example F'
falls above, and the other M below.

In the first case: now clearly we have the exact equal-
ity asserted between all rectilinear right angles,

But not in the second; because thus the angle LHF,
here it is DAF, will be less than the angle DAB, and its
