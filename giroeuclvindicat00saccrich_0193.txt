COROLLARY.

But this standing, which in the last case was demon-
strated, it manifestly follows that those straights AX,
ΒΧ, produced infinitely will finally have, either in two
distinct pointS, or in o'ne same point X infinitely distant.
a 'common perpendicular.

But again, that this common perpendicular cannot be
had in two distinct points flows manifestly frorn this, be-
cause otherwise (by Cor. II. to P. XXIII.) those straights
would thence begin mutually to separate‚· and so not meet
each other at an infinite distance; so that also (against
the express supposition) they would not mutually ap-
proach each other without. any certain limit ever more
toward those parts, μ

So they must have the common perpendicular in one
same point X infinitely distant. [63]

PROPOSITION XXIX.

Res-mnino fiy. 33 of the preceding proposition: I say
every straight AC, which cnts angle BAX, finally
at a finite, or terminated distance (even in the hy-
pothesis of acute angle) will meet ΒΧ in a certain

point P, if only AC be produced ever rn-ore toward
the parts of the points X.

PRooF. And first indeed (lest straight AC include
space with AX) it must meet at finite distance the
straights LK, HK, DK in certain points C, N, M3 must
meet, I say, unless before (and that at a finite distance,
just as we maintain) it meets BX in some point between
the point B and one of the points K.

Then (from Cor. I. to P. XXIII.) the angles ACK.
, ΑΝΚ, ΑΜΚ will be obtuse.

Moreover those angleS‚ always obtuse, approach
