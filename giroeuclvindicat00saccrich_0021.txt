INTRODUCTION.

Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri was born at San Remo in
the night between the 4th and 5th of September, 1667, as
the authority on his life, the late Alberto Pascal tells uS.

He was notably preeocious

March 24, 1685, he entered the Jesuit order. Toward
1690 he terminated the period of novitiate at Genoa and
was sent by his superiors to the Collegio di Brera in Milan,
to teach grammar and at the same time to study philosophy
and theology. There the reading of the Elements of Euclid
was recommended to him by the professor of mathematiCS,
the Jesuit father Torrnnaso Ceva, from whose brother Gio-
vanni the theorem Ceva is named.

In 1694 Saccheri was commanded to teach philosophy
and polemie theology in the Collegio dei Gesuiti of Turin.
In 1697 he was sent to Pavia. Says Pascal, “Fruit of these
three years of philosophie teaehing was a little book which
well merits to be better known: perhaps its extreme rarity
has contribut-ed to this oblivion, even since Giovanni Vailati‚
in 1903, brought to light its superlative merit.'’

The few brief pages of Vailati‚ who died in 1909, furnish
the only help on this librata, an opera dimenticata first ap-
pearing with what he calls the titolo abbastanza eniymatico:

Loyica demonstrativa, quam una cum Thesibus ex tota
Philosophia decerptis, defendendam proponit Ioannes Fran-
ciscus Casalette Graveriarum Comes sub auspiciis Reyiae
C elsitudinis Victorii Amedei II. Sabaudiae Ducis, Pede-
montium Principis, Cypri Reyis‚ etc.
